Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I Background 
Background 
This book is Volume I in a series of two books on how to master Small- and Medium-Sized Projects –  SMPs. These projects are those that seldom receive serious attention in the regular project literature of  today. For better or worse, it is the large, costly, complicated projects that are written about, researched  and discussed in the media. 
But the popularity of the project approach means that many smaller, “everyday” tasks can be performed as  projects. These smaller projects, whose goal and purpose are often very different from those of the bigger  projects, also need a different type of approach than the large and more complex projects. Preliminary  studies are typical. They are short-term investigations put in motion to pave the way for a larger project  and require much less in terms of personnel for the actual project work.  
It is interesting to note that this is not a new way of operating. Before mass production made its debut,  all production was carried out as projects. The individual craftsman made a copy of a product that was  individually adapted for the customer. Even car production worked this way until Henry Ford discovered  that both mass production and routine production could save unit costs at larger volumes.  
This book is written as a continuation of the Norwegian book, Prosjektledelse Trinn for Trinn (Jessen, S.A.,  2005, 2008),1 though it has a different format. While the Norwegian book’s flyer idea is retained in this  book called Stepstones, the traditional tools for planning and controlling projects are replaced by much  simpler tools. The new book further elaborates on what a project leader should do when confronted  with everyday problems, things that happen outside strategic plans and tactical project dispositions. The  focus is on how to lead people as much as it is on how to lead systems. 
The picture on the front of this book is a simple illustration of what a Stepstone is. The photo was shot  in Pompeii, and shows how people 2,000 years ago had to move about to cope with flowing rainwater  in the streets. They “stepped on stones” to get to their destination – in this case the other side of the  street – and then they used their “Stepstones” in front of their doors to enter their houses. Project work  is really much the same – finding a way to reach your destination and fulfilling the project mission. 
In order to address these challenges, this book systematically reviews the “Stepstones” any project manager  needs to negotiate, but primarily concentrates on the small- and medium-sized projects – the so-called  SMPs. Every Stepstone begins with some theory before we explore the practical features. Our example  project is to organize a small conference. The sections on theory include remarks on what has to be  done in any project, regardless of size. Illustrations in the practical tools section refer to the conference  project example.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Background 
In Volume I, the “upstream” steps in SMPs are presented, i.e. from Stepstone # 1, which identifies  the SMP, until Stepstone # 8, which talks about signing the contract and agreeing on starting up the  project. Volume II of the series will present the “downstream” steps in SMPs, i.e. from starting up the  SMP, Stepstone # 9: The Kickoff Meeting, through executing, following up, controlling, completing and  measuring the project’s success, Stepstone # 15. In addition, Volume II has three Stepstones on how to  plan, control and manage risk in more detail if necessary in the SMP. 
The Norwegian version of the background book can be found at www.universitetsforlaget.no/smp/ (ISBN  978-82-15-01365-7) – this is the book Norwegian students and people engaged in project work in general  should preferably buy, following the Norwegian Løpesedlene for support in their project endeavors. The  copyediting was done by Maury Saslaff: m.saslaff@gmail.com. 
An important message to the reader: 
The first edition of this book came in April 2010. The book was meant for continuous updating by both  readers and users! The field of Project Management is developing so rapidly that what was good theory  and relevant practice yesterday may well be different today. For that reason, I would very much appreciate  comments and ideas from everybody interested in improving this field. Please use the e-mail address  below for any comments you have! 
In this edition the book is updated and renewed, in the sense that the questions asked at the end of each  chapter is simplified to only report “yes” or “no”. That should make the book(s) even easier to use both  for theoretical and practical purposes!

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I Introduction 
Introduction 
We frequently talk about “changing society,”2 but society has always been changing. Today, “change”  seems to have become an intrusive concept, possibly because change occurs at a much faster pace than  before, and the consequences are much more extensive.3 Even small changes have greater consequences  than we were previously aware of. “Chaos theory” predicts that a butterfly flapping its wings in Australia  can set off a tropical storm in the Atlantic two years later.4, 5 The global impact of human activity on  the environment is another relevant example, which is why it is important to understand that even  the smallest change can have a devastating effect.6 As a result, the small projects we initiate should be  treated with respect since they might be the start of larger, more important and decisive changes that  affect ourselves, our organizations and our community in the long run. 
Most practical books and manuals deal with large, complex projects which is not unnatural. Using projects  to solve problems has never been more popular than it is today. By the end of the last century, 25% of  the world’s spending was managed through projects according to some reports, and many projects are  clearly very large and very costly. Keeping track of them requires good management and good tools.  Project planning and project organization need to be sound, and every step must be controlled down  to the very last detail.7 If a large project starts going off the track and is heading for failure, it will cost  the organization dearly and have many other adverse effects as well.8 
But most projects are not enormous. Today, the project approach is equally used for smaller and simpler tasks.9 To  run the projects that we in this book will call SMPs – Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – the tools and methods  we need are much simpler. When projects are small, mistakes are often not as serious. And even if they end up  doing something other than what was originally envisaged, lessons can be drawn and we can look at them as  exciting experiments in new ways of thinking and acting. As the proverb says, “only those who get lost, discover  new ways.” One probably forgotten benefit of many SMPs is the excitement, not to mention the opportunity, of  learning. Indeed, a project may have unexpected benefits for its participants, clients and users.  
While rigidity can be stifling, too little formality can easily create a mess. It is easy to go from flexibility to chaos or  to lose sight of things when too much change is taking place at the same time. The best way for working on both  large and small projects is to always ensure a good mix of formality and creativity. It takes rules and creativity for  people to work well together in an innovative and effective manner, and the same goes for respecting each other  and maintaining a sense of enthusiasm in order to help, support and stimulate cooperation.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Introduction 
Nevertheless, many projects fail regardless of their size and type, and there are as many unsuccessful as successful  ones. So why does the project form remain so popular despite its many failures? Here are some of the reasons:  
1. Projects identify problems and deal with them at the source. 
2. Project work is one of the better ways of achieving unique goals. 
3. Projects go well with the management of scarce resources.  
4. The project’s organization reduces the risk of working with new ways on new types of tasks.  5. Project work requires clear responsibility for key tasks from start to finish.  
6. A project’s staff experiences their own role as one of being focused and meaningful. 7. Projects facilitate proper communication within the project and with the project’s environment.  
These points are appealing. They are, however, primarily based on the experience of working in large projects since  we have believed that when a smaller project fails, it is almost always due to bad planning, poor management and a  lack of the type of discipline and rules that characterizes larger projects. Rules tell team members how to visualize  the project as a whole, although you must remember to plan the operation in detail and keep a tight rein on project  management. These ideas are set out in handbooks, systems and models that tell us what good project management  is regardless of size and type. As argued by many modern scholars, traditional project literature has viewed projects  very much as an analytical process, unable to explain the systemic character inherent in most projects.10 
Today, we should ask whether some of these general ideas fit the bill. “Best practice”5 might not be the best standard  for all projects. More importantly, we also need to critically examine the standardized and elaborate project recipes11 to see if they really work for all projects. Not all problems that can be “projectified” need to be tightly controlled  and organized in order to guarantee success.12 There are many reasons for this opinion:

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Introduction 
First, the project approach cannot solve every problem from large financial investments and huge technical  installations to groundbreaking research and exceptional innovations, in addition to smaller improvements at the  company-internal level such as short-term operations in order to reduce bureaucracy or improve ad hoc training  programs. As with scientific research, we have to decide whether the objective is simply to reproduce something  (“surface approach”), achieve something (“strategic approach”) or find meaning (“deep approach).” There are  differences between “Academic Susan” and “Strategic Robert.”13 Similarly, for SMPs we need to start with the real  objective, then look for some simple, basic criteria to define what the project approach is really all about. We then  need to check and see if these basic criteria are met and then select the type of SMP that best solves the problem.  If the criteria are met, there are many ways to make smaller projects successful apart from following the same  procedures as you would for larger projects. In fact, brain researchers14 have found that although knowledge is  power, too much knowledge can drain one’s energy. Many managers acquire a great deal of information  and in-depth analyses in abundance, but may become completely paralyzed when faced with a practical  problem. They run the risk of acting like a computer, performing logical calculations, but getting illogical  answers in return. The best answers often come from qualified guesswork based on a combination of  experience and new information which yield new insights. One should never ignore one’s ability to make  good decisions. It is always a good idea to test out one’s gut feeling before taking action, and as talent  qualification tests show, “chaos pilots” are often the best project leaders because they love to be thrown  in at the deep end and are brilliant at using networking to survive. They are extremely busy, maintain a  high tempo and make things happen,15 which is the underlying recipe in many SMPs. 
Second, projects can easily dilute an organization’s leading expertise.16 Projects tend to absorb an organization’s  current stockpile of expertise without renewing it. Managerial responsibility for ensuring that individual employees  can learn and develop new skills risks being dissipated since it is very seldom included in the project plan. The  project manager will naturally be more concerned with achieving the project’s goal(s) than developing new  knowledge for his/her workers. Indeed, project managers might be more engrossed in “whittling away” than  maintaining work standards.17 Unless we take care of what we learn, we risk losing many of the valuable benefits  of working with projects.  
Third, any model is a simplification of a more complicated reality.18, 19 Models, including project models, often give  a better understanding of a situation, but are no guarantee of success. Many of today’s leaders are rightly suspicious  of models because they give overly precise answers to complex problems. For projects, this is particularly relevant  since it is impossible to model the unique, and as previously mentioned, uniqueness is one of the main reasons  for using the project approach to problem solving.

Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – SMPs 
Fourth, it is an accepted fact that most project literature has focused on “downstream” activities.20 That is, how to  execute well-defined tasks and achieve well-defined goals. Investigations have unearthed compelling evidence  of the value of project management when the project form of problem solving is appropriately managed.21 So far, project management has been similarly occupied with how to run an operation so well that in the end we  achieve exactly what we decided on before we started, though there are some problems with this. For example,  it assumes the future can be projected with so much accuracy that what we consider to be important today, we  are convinced will be important in the future as well. There are several areas where this is hardly correct. Indeed,  nowadays the future is increasingly difficult to predict, so the current project focus must therefore be different.  If we need to review changes to a planned project process, we should be willing to carefully go over our original  plan before rejecting new ideas out of hand. The more we regard project competence as something that can be  continually built up, the more we can use it rapidly and beneficially.  
Fifth, there are big differences between projects. Projects today are not only large, complex and costly, as there are an  increasing number of small, simple and short-term, yet very important, SMPs. But even if different projects need to  be treated differently, many “large” projects could benefit from being treated as SMPs, realizing that modern projects  are dynamic, iterative and often even chaotic systems. Modern projects should better be viewed as evolutionary  and path-dependent systems composed of episodes displaying various dynamics, and project management recipes  must reflect this.22 In doing so, many laborious operations, which may later have been found to be unnecessary and  served only to waste the time and energy of the project staff who could have been working to improve the main  project, can be simplified as the aim is to reach the project’s goal and support its ultimate mission. These projects,  the SMPs, are the types of projects this book is concerned with.

Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – SMPs 
1 Small- and Medium-Sized  Projects – SMPs 
1.1 Why SMPs are So Important 
Understanding the importance of SMPs comes primarily from recognizing that “upstream activities”  are as important as “downstream” activities since downstream activities are related to the delivery of  the end product. Both upstream activities and upstream projects create, justify and support successful  downstream activities. For this reason, we are aware of the need to spend more time on these projects, often  small ones, which directly or indirectly are created for ensuring good, sustainable results downstream.  Unfortunately, we are not always able to predict the success rate of a downstream project at an early stage.  We may have ideas, of course, and there are recognized ways of improving our guesswork in terms of  the future. Very often it is only after the project has been started, and operational reality produces new  and better information, that we begin to understand a project’s real value.  
This double process is not necessarily easy. Large businesses, especially those in the public sector, are  often very reluctant to change and experiment. Many projects are under strong pressure to start and  end with uncompromising goals and strict terms of reference (TOR). Regulations, procedures and safety  instructions dominate, although a high specification at the start of a project may well undermine its  flexibility in the later stages. If new information is to be acted upon during a project’s execution, the  users, owners and other recipients of the project’s results should not oppose new possibilities, but should  instead come on board and support beneficial adjustments. Changes for the better must simply be seen  as an opportunity, not as something wrong with the situation. Today, we need to accept that many  projects are dynamic arenas where new ideas and knowledge are brought in which influence a project  and its goals. Success must be seen as more than delivering an initial order. The project’s benefits must be  determined not only by the technical fulfillment of its initial goal, but also by the project’s contribution  to the realization of its mission.23

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – SMPs 
This is important, especially for SMPs. So where do we find SMPs and what typifies them? In fact, SMPs  are typically found wherever the development of new products, services and processes requires research  and innovation. The methods used are intended to integrate people as users and co-creators throughout  the development process in order to recognize the needs of users and the working conditions of service  providers in their actual contexts. In other words, SMPs are found everywhere. A well-planned pilot  project or subproject of a larger project might be an SMP or an upstream project such as a profitability  analysis, investment calculation or the development of a minor, but specific internal administrative  management or control system. At the same time, SMPs are crucial parts of larger project portfolios and  project programs within companies. Moreover, SMPs can be used by the public and private sector for  transient planning purposes such as arranging special events, launching training programs, initiating  school projects that encourage students to collaborate, undertaking minor internal reorganizations, taking  simple steps to improve daily operations – or for that matter – to manage an entirely personal activity  that requires some preparation and monitoring to improve its chances of success. The variety is great,  as is the number of people engaged in SMPs.  
In this context, it is important to realize that projects are also social arenas, and many people enjoy  working with projects. Projects offer a break from everyday routine and often present an exhilarating  challenge. Reaching the target and excelling under close supervision are important, though not the only  important and stimulating things, as the way work goes on, how the actors are involved, how they work,  how they communicate and the responsibility and respect they show for each other are what matters. All  of this is also typical for SMPs. Research has demonstrated that the fewer the participants in a project,  the closer and more rewarding the teamwork and the building of mutual respect.24 
As must be clear at this point, we can hardly experiment too much with our own resources in large and  complex projects. In large projects, we probably have to believe that “upstream understanding” will be  good enough for downstream success, and the targeted results will be valid at the project’s conclusion. 
In SMPs, we can allow ourselves to think differently. Because the workload is less, we can go along  with a greater degree of flexibility. In fact, we can take more chances, experiment more, put up with a  few mistakes and enjoy exciting coincidences and stimulating creativity simply because the cost of the  mistakes is less. This freedom to make mistakes is essential for motivating modern people, encouraging  a greater commitment and eagerness for acquiring good project skills through learning-by-doing. People  with a creative attitude tend to be more motivated to do a good job. The clue is not to be told “when”  and “what” to do according to a prescription, but also “why” it has to be done in order to be open for  “how” to do it, depending on our understanding of the situation and project setting.

1.2 What Separates the Large and Resource-Consuming Projects from SMPs? 
It is not always easy to distinguish major projects from small projects, as large projects in a small  organization may be as well regarded as small projects in a major one. Some large projects may be easy  to execute, while some small ones can be very complex.  
Yet there seem to be some differences between the large projects with many actors, and small and simple  ones, with fewer people involved. Table 1.1 below illustrates some typical features of large, complex  projects compared with small and simple projects such as SMPs.

Table 1.1 – Some of the differences between the large and complex projects and the small- and medium-sized projects, the SMPs.  
The first thing one notices is that large and resource-intensive projects will be the most successful. A  tight control on performance, target achievement, the reduction of risk and chaos and clear roles for all  involved should help to guarantee success, although this is not necessarily always the case. Many small  projects actually succeed in spite of lacking many of a “professional” project’s features. This is because  SMPs come with their own benefits, some of which are listed in Table 1.2: 
Large and Complex Projects SMPs 
* Are resource-intensive and have a great need for  
* Commit fewer resources and do not require detailed plans

Table 1.2 – Some typical advantages of SMPs compared to large and complex projects. 
Against this backdrop, it makes sense to develop some simpler procedures for projects that can be  categorized as SMPs. In fact, many such procedures are just as useful for larger and more complex projects.

1.3 How to Read The Books The books have two main purposes: 
Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – SMPs 
1. They are a recipe for showing how small- and medium-sized projects, SMPs, can be run  from start to finish so that better results are achieved. But many of the book’s principles are  also appropriate for larger projects and are intended to be universal regardless of the size  and complexity of the project.  
2. They are reference books that point to many common pitfalls at all stages of SMP  management and leadership. Many of the pitfalls are specific to SMPs, but many are also  found in large and complex projects. The book should therefore be useful as a work of  reference for people involved in large and complex projects as well. 
The books cover the major project steps: identification, preparation, organization, implementation,  management and leadership of projects: 
Chapter 2: What is an SMP?  
Chapter 3: How to Choose the Right SMP  
Chapter 4: How to Schedule and Organize SMPs  
Volume II contains the following chapters: 
Chapter 5: How to Lead SMPs  
Chapter 6: How to Increase the Chances of an SMP’s success  
In each of these chapters, the book has introduced “Stepstones.” They are the backbone of the book and  replace the traditional project “gates,” formal recipes or similar, traditional forms of governance. At the  same time, the Stepstone approach provides a “model” of how a project should be handled. This is because  a model improves the coordination of human input, human reactions and the harvesting of experience.  A good model breaks down barriers and reduces misunderstandings.

Before each Stepstone, two main areas of concern are discussed: the theoretical support behind the  statements in the Stepstone and a menu of practical suggestions and instructions on how to improve your  score at each Stepstone. This is because theory is always meant to be a wider discussion of a subject  and taken out of a concrete decision-making situation, focusing on the general aspects, not the specifics.  Unfortunately, the wide use of the project way of problem solving has not always been reflected in the  academic debate because some theorists have claimed too much authority. Instead of presenting a menu  of opportunities and setting up a list of relevant options, theorists often transfer their own social and  political views. Instead of being analytical, they often tend to favor one set of mappings over another.  The reason for this is therefore rooted in the well-known proverb that says “what is worth learning  cannot necessarily be taught.”25 Competing statements are “Nothing is as practical as a good theory”26,  and “Nothing is as dangerous as a bad theory”.27 
We know that the modern project concept is a tool with multiple models. Each of them gives a different,  stylized representation of some aspect of reality. Being an accomplished project leader means to pick and  choose the right model for a given situation. Some writers refer to this as a fix on positivism.  
By definition, positivism is an epistemological position that advocates the application of natural science  methodology to the study of social reality.28 This book’s Stepstones are meant to be helpful in making  better “positivistic” choices, particularly for SMPs. 
In total, the books present 15 basic Stepstones and three detailed Stepstones. The latter deals with events  that may occur in some SMPs and are found in separate appendices, and are meant to be used only if  needed. The 15 basic ones, however, are considered compulsory for any project, especially SMPs.  
Except for the first two Stepstones, every Stepstone comes with 10 questions on important matters any  project leader and key stakeholder should be aware of when running a project from its early stages to  its final delivery and post-evaluation.  
For any project we intend to start, these important assessments of an investment’s real value should be  made and carried out prior to any further time- and resource-consuming project efforts. This applies not  only to financial investments, but to investments of a social or human related nature as well. To misuse  resources for an unhealthy project investment is something we know will be both negatively observed  and may well create adverse precedents for decision makers the next time around.  
To ensure that we are on the correct path, we need the score not be less than 8 “yes” at each Stepstone.  This rule is more or less based on the Pareto principle, which advises a correctness or fulfillment rate  of 80% in order to achieve further progress and development in many real-life situations.29 If we score  less than 80%, we need to either go back and re-read the relevant text for that Stepstone, re-plan the entire  project or simply stop it. The purpose of each Stepstone is to create a better understanding, better decisions  and better project progress. To ensure the Stepstones are working properly, they are summarized in a logical  pattern as shown in Figure 1.1 below:

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Small- and Medium-Sized Projects – SMPs 
This sequence of Stepstones should be followed as closely as possible. As the reader will see, the arrows  point in both directions. Each new Stepstone is therefore either a signal to go ahead, to go back and  adjust, or to stop. At the same time, the Stepstones pose questions and bring up matters that represent  typical pitfalls in the progress of projects, again particularly for SMPs.  
Each Stepstone has two additional components: communication and motivation. Good communication is  vital for a project in all its phases.30 Effective communication can be divided into a rhetorical situation and  the ethos or credibility of the sender.31 The first has to do with the problem of identification, the receiver’s  state or situation and the message one wants to send. The second deals with the practical significance of  the message, its moral content and the benevolence felt by the sender to the receiver.21 To achieve perfect  communication is quite difficult, probably impossible. As contended above, the content and form of the  communication will vary depending on when and how it takes place, as well as the identity of the senders  and recipients. Additionally, the role of the communication must be understood. Vertical communication is normally used to control an organization and coordinate its activities and employees, while horizontal  communication is used to facilitate creative processes, activate and utilize organizational knowledge assets,  and coordinate and carry out actions. It is the combination of formal and informal communication that  determines the efficiency of an organization, and communication skills are a basic skill for all employees.32 
So for each Stepstone, the book only suggests whether the communication should be directed towards  individuals or groups, and offers certain guidelines on how to communicate. The basic idea is that the  best management in any culture takes place in a climate of rich communication. The first thing we  learn in a threatening or hostile climate is to protect ourselves, which limits the richness and value of  communication. It is important to be aware of the communicational aspect of emotions, as they represent  a special case as far as the communication and determination of meaning. For that reason, one should  strive to communicate in as many ways as possible when running an SMP. 
The same importance rests with motivation. Motivation is highly significant in all project phases.20 Motivation has to be tailor-made for each phase of a project and for each of the main actors in those  phases. For every Stepstone, a list is provided about what seems, at least according to both theory and  practice, to motivate as well as demotivate the most.33 
As illustrated in Figure 1.2 below, Stepstones represent the highest level, Level 1, and deal with the  complete SMP process from start to finish. Milestones represent Level 2 and start during the planning of  the project work at Stepstone #7. Milestones are points at which you should take stock of the progress  from the time the actual project work starts, which is after Stepstone #9, the “SMP’s Kickoff Meeting.”  Cooperation Charts constitute Level 3 and indicate who is responsible for what. They are used to show  the division of roles and responsibilities of the people involved in the project between milestones.

Figure 1.2 – Levels, Stepstones, Milestones and Cooperation Chart. 
All projects also have a Level 4, which consists of the operating activities. These activities specify the  work to be done by the project’s participants during the project’s execution. 
1.4 Summary of Chapter 1 
The first chapter in this book has discussed the increasing use of the project approach in modern societies,  in addition to some of the reasons. The chapter also discusses why it makes sense to distinguish between  the traditional, recommended recipes for mastering large and complex projects, as well as how to think,  manage and lead smaller and simpler projects, the SMPs. 
The chapter also offers advice on how this book can best be read and used.  
1.5 The Conference Example  
For each of the Stepstones in the book, a simple example of an SMP is shown in a frame and blue-colored text. The  example is to plan and carry out a successful three-day conference for our company. Arranging a conference in many  ways is a typical SMP since a successful conference for all involved and affected will depend on actions taken by the  project leader before, during and after the conference. 
While these steps are exemplified in each chapter in the book, SMP leaders do not have to slavishly follow them. They  simply show how a project leader can use Stepstones and some simple, but typical tools and methods to improve the  chances of a project’s success. 
The reader should nevertheless know that since projects by definition are always unique, in principle there is no final  management for our particular project or any other for that matter. How we act completely depends on what we are  aiming to achieve with the project, on the project’s mission, its TOR, the type of actors involved plus the users and the  wider project environment. Thus, the case presented is just one example of what can be done when working with SMPs.

2 What is an SMP  
Stepstone # 1:  
Screening of the SMP Idea 2.1 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 1 
What is an SMP 
There are no such things as projects in nature. Projects are created by humans. What is interesting is  that unlike many phenomena in science, there is no single, authoritative definition of creativity based  on our theoretical knowledge so far. And unlike many phenomena in psychology, there is no subsequent  standardized measurement technique for creative behavior and how it is evoked. 
Traditionally, creativity is more or less defined as an intricate mental and social process involving the  discovery of new ideas or concepts, or new associations of the creative mind between existing ideas or  concepts. Thus, creativity is fueled by the process of either conscious or unconscious insight. A simpler  conception of creativeness is that it is simply the act of making something new, which is the product of  “divergent thought,” and is usually considered to have both originality and appropriateness.34

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
What is an SMP 
For these reasons, creative activity fits well in the early project phases. In addition, the creative decision on  which project to use money and energy on is of vital importance for the ultimate success of a project. In  the past, we have not put a sufficient focus on this part of the project and often took for granted that the  idea that was later converted to a full project was the result of thorough thinking and a close evaluation  at the top level. Unfortunately, if this is not the case, the result could be that in later project phases one  would be confronted with a reasonable amount of criticism for putting too little thought into both the  idea and the problem identification phase. These early steps are therefore best justified if grounded in a  mix of sound creative investigations and concrete analyses.  
At this stage we already have a problem because finding really good ideas is not so easy. Based on the  knowledge we have today, we may come up with many ideas since the good news is that all human  beings are born with creativity and are perhaps the only creative animal on earth. Although creativity  is intuitively a common phenomenon used on a daily basis, it is in fact quite complex. Creativeness has  been studied from many perspectives such as behavioral psychology, social psychology, psychometrics,  cognitive science, artificial intelligence, philosophy, aesthetics, history, economics, design research,  business and management among others. Some have even argued that creativity contains an element of  pure chance and luck.  
However, the most popular view is that creativity can be identified and associated with right or frontal  brain activity or specifically with “lateral thinking.” If such is the case, creativity should be able to be  mastered more professionally. Studies have concluded that creativity can be systemized and perhaps  simplified into three types: “everyday creativity”, “exceptional creativity” and “artificial creativity.” If we  look into the requirements of projects, it seems natural to use the two latter forms in the early phases of  the project, while “everyday creativity”, which we will come back to, seems to be of special importance  for the execution and control of a project. It is also important to use creativeness in a slightly different  way depending on which stage of development a project is currently in, as well as in ways that fit the  various stages of project development. 
2.2 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 1 
Nonetheless, even if creativity can be managed to a certain extent, it seems to be a trait that differs from  person to person and is one that some are born with more than others. On the other hand, creativity  can be taught with the application of some simple creative techniques. Although popularly associated  with art and literature, it is an essential part of innovation and invention, and is important in professions  such as business, economics, industrial design, graphic design, advertising, mathematics, science and  engineering, teaching – and project management.

What is an SMP 
The first important message from all of this is that there are no theoretical projects, only real ones. Since  creativity is so multifarious, it seems that the most practical way to utilize it is to come up with many  ideas and then discard the less useful ones.35 This coincides with another practical definition of creativity  which is that it is an “assumptions-breaking process.”36 Creative ideas are in fact often generated when we  discard preconceived assumptions and attempt new approaches or methods that may seem unthinkable  to others. 
Even so, moving from many ideas to deciding which one is the best is yet another obstacle. In the early  stages, few things about a project are directly measurable. Ideas are often just interesting thoughts or  underlying desires or inspirations that are difficult to express in precise terms. The good thing is that  there are a number of simple, practical views that can be of great help, especially in project work. Below,  some of them are discussed and related to the first project phase – the initiation phase. In broader terms,  they constitute three major domains: 
1. Creativity in coming up with new ideas; 
2. Creativity in ranking new ideas; 
3. Creativity in selecting the best idea for a new project.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 2.2.1 Creating New Project Ideas 
What is an SMP 
For an organization, the ability to foresee the future as being more than pure guesswork is extremely  important, although the fact is that we do not know too much about the future. It is part of what makes  us curious and active, and it is our ignorance that makes us struggle to find the right measures to both  protect and develop ourselves.  
Simplified, there are two ways to think ahead: exploratively and normatively. The difference between  these two directions is illustrated in Figure 2.1. below: 
The Future The Future 
Projects Projects 
The Present The Present 
Figure 2.1 – Explorative and Normative Thinking. 
When we think exploratively, we believe our assumptions about the future to be more or less correct,  and explore or “examine” the future based on what we know up until the present moment. We can use  visionary thinking, or we can use some recommended type of projection method. Whatever the result  may be, we end up with various types of forecasts. Such forecasts, called prognoses, are based largely  on the belief that the future will more or less follow well-known scenarios from the past. If different  types of prognoses end up with the same scenarios or trends, we can expect that they will not die out  immediately. If more and more of the same product are sold, we can expect that this will continue to take  place, at least for the foreseeable future, which is normally the case. Based on these forecasts, we should  then choose our marketing, production, control measures and sales efforts. When we use explorative  thinking, we should therefore assess which measures to take in order to adjust to a development we very  much believe will occur. When we do this, we make ourselves ready to master this development in the  best possible way with the most relevant projects.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
What is an SMP 
The alternative is to think normatively, which takes less into account in terms of trends and imagines  instead that we are already a certain number of years into the future. As a result, we make a dream picture of how we want ourselves, our environment, our company or our organization to look and function like  at that time. This is often referred to as the organization’s or company’s mission, in which the purpose  is to create a motivating and guiding principle or overall purpose. When this is decided upon, “we turn  the arrows” and ask: What should these arrows contain in order for this to happen? Such thinking is  also called scenario-thinking. When we have agreed that this can be the reality if we prepare for it, we  implement projects which contribute to making that future happen. At that point projects are not only  “operations,” as many explorative projects are, but are also important parts of strategy, which is typical  of the normative approach.  
If we look at trends, it is obvious that some are for the benefit of both individuals and societies. Better living  conditions, better health, better financial development, better purchasing power and better educational  opportunities are all trends that we are grateful for and would like to further develop by the use of,  among other good things, successful projects. Other trends such as increasing crime, Islamic terrorism  and environmental pollution are adverse, and we should counteract and reduce these. To reverse such  trends, we must find the right counteraction in the form of appropriate projects. To master such projects,  we must understand the background of these trends. We must consider what we particularly need to  take into account, what framework we need to create and how and where to find the proper sources of  information in order for us to implement the best counteractive projects. To accomplish that we often  have to go deeper and search for underlying forces that can both directly and indirectly support our  effort. In fact, this is also a good recommendation for positive trends. Understanding reason is always  of great benefit in our struggle to find the best solution. Some trends are for the better, and many are  easily observed because they arise, dominate and force us to react in a positive way, while others are  negative and force us to act, though often with delimited alternatives. 
Regardless of which trends we observe, there are two ways to react to trends in principle: We can wait  and see, and then act. When doing so in this manner we are “reactive,” which is often the case with  explorative thinking and explorative trends. The other alternative is to assume an observed change as the  beginning of a larger trend and then take immediate and appropriate action. When we take this position,  we are “proactive” in relation to a possible trend. Both actions are risky. When we wait and see, we may  lose ground because others have already acted and we are too late to properly counteract or be the first  to harvest important benefits. However, if we act too early it means that we may have misunderstood  the trend and have used time, money and effort on investments of limited value. The trick is to find the  correct balance and create project ideas that support the desired changes.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 2.2.2 Ranking Ideas 
What is an SMP 
Whether a project is exploratively or normatively based, every project is a deliberate investment. A good  investment is characterized by the fact that what we get back is more valuable than what we put in. This  is the law of economics regardless of whether the project is large or small, but one must also be aware  that receivers, such as customers and users, can be bad at explaining what they really want and what is  most valuable to them. Often, they simply need some help in clarifying their desires and needs in order  for the value of what they get back in the end to be good enough. A good way to check this is to make  an investment calculation in the form of a feasibility study. 
The principle for such benefit-cost studies is illustrated below in Figure 2.2.2: 
Benefits 
Time > 1 
Costs

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s  electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know how is crucial to running a large proportion of the  world’s wind turbines.  
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our  systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic  lubrication. We help make it more economical to create  cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air.  
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity,  industries can boost performance beyond expectations.  Therefore we need the best employees who can  meet this challenge!

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
What is an SMP 
Although the formula is very simple, it carries an important message: the ratio must be greater than 1.  This means that the benefits of the project must somehow be greater than the costs. The first problem  is that it is not always easy to measure these two variables on the same scale. For instance, costs can be  direct in simple, measurable quantities such as money. But costs can also be indirect, such as the loss  of reputation or trust, or resistance and discomfort following the investment. As has been wisely said,  “You cannot formulate one universal cost term, you have to establish different cost terms and measures  for different purposes.”37 The benefit of course can be measured in money, though it can also be more  qualitative and difficult to quantify such as social and environmental benefits, image, public opinion or  social benefits. And even if we should find a common yardstick such as money, it can be difficult for  costs and benefits if they come at different times. This is illustrated below in Figure 2.2.3: 
Benefits 
Time > 1 
Costs 
Fig 2.2.3 – Time orientation of the Benefit-Cost ratio. 
For most projects, this is the reality. We first use costs to create something valuable or something we  presume will be beneficial in the future. When the final product is made and the project goal has been  reached, we reap the rewards, earnings, enthusiasm or other types of benefits. It is clear that when the  benefits take place in the distant future, they are even more unknown than the costs, but it becomes  more uncertain as to whether the benefits will really manifest themselves and be large enough to justify  the costs. After all, it is the costs that we have the best chance to manage and control. The benefits are  often the users and the client, as well as other stakeholders who measure and evaluate. So, instead of  money, one enlarges the concept to “resources,” with a more accurate diagram of how investments must  be judged shown below in Figure 2.2.4:

Figure 2.2.4 – Schematic diagram of investment estimates. 
The curve showing the accumulated resource consumption of the investment project starts at time zero  when resource consumption is also zero. In the first phase, the project is prepared, planned, implemented  and terminated with the finished product. Basically, all these activities entail spending. It is only afterwards  that the returns on the investment start to flow. Gradually, the accumulated curve rotates and penetrates  (with any luck) the zero axis. At that juncture, the investment’s resource commitment is completely  reimbursed by its earnings, so at this point the project has reached its “break even” point. Given that  returns continue to flow in, the investment will return a profit, and the height and length of the curve  give a visual impression of how profitable the investment will become over time. Both visually and  mathematically, this is the principle for estimating a project investment’s total profitability. 
The next thing to take into consideration is the fact that particularly within healthy economic societies,  we always have a certain degree of inflation, i.e. that the value of money decreases over time. The reasons  for inflation are manifold. The simplest way to explain why inflation is quite normal is that a country  steadily prints more bank notes in order to cope with the increasing price of goods and services, and a  price increase naturally follows when there is a shortage of these same commodities. If more and more  people want to buy the same commodity, it will become less available. Following that line of thought,  each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services, so inflation erodes the purchasing power of money.  This can then be compensated for by an increase in salaries and earnings for people and companies. With  low inflation, this tends to create a good, timely balance between the amount of goods bought and the  amount of money available. Thus, the economy will develop in a way that everybody finds acceptable.  For the same sum of money one year, a person will receive slightly less for it the next year. To some  extent, these are negative effects, although there are also positive effects. Inflation supports a mitigation  of economic recession and debt relief by reducing the real level of debt. As compensation, a cost one  year will be a slightly smaller cost or debt the next.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
What is an SMP 
In terms of projects, much of this relationship can be computed by the use of both simple and very  advanced calculation tools. There are alternatives for both benefits and costs, and one can simulate  different outcomes of the benefit-cost ratio. What is quite popular today is that the calculations for  every year reduce both the costs and benefits with the loss in value these two variables will successively  be assumed to have, thereby creating the so-called Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment. If the  NPV > 0, the investment is positive; if it is less, we should probably spend our money or other scarce  resources on something else. Another way to look at this is to assume that at the end of the investment  period the benefits will be equal to the costs and then calculate at which fixed reducing rate per year  this will occur, ending with the project’s Internal Rate of Return (IRR).38 If this rate is lower than what  the other investment most probably will yield in return, i.e. the “opportunity rate,” we should not invest  in this proposal. 
For any project we intend to start, these important assessments of an investment’s real value should be  made and carried out prior to any further time- and resource-consuming project efforts. This applies not  only to financial investments, but to investments of a social or human related nature as well. To misuse  resources for an unhealthy project investment is something we know will be both negatively observed  and may well create adverse precedents for decision makers the next time around. 
Projects are investments and have to be exposed to some benefit-cost evaluation, which is also a correct  view for SMPs. But when a project is small, the danger is that we make such extensive and elaborate  investment investigations that the total cost of the evaluation plus the later execution and control costs  overrun any possible benefits. Even if the calculations show a positive benefit-cost ratio, the decision to  start the project may still not be well justified enough since many SMPs suffer such evaluations from  simply too many calculations. Since all ideas about the future will be speculative anyhow, costs and benefits  still involve a fair amount of guesswork, and even the best calculations that are based on guesswork will  conclude with guesswork as well. In addition, it seems that many estimates deprive us of the opportunity  to use intuition and a “gut-feeling.” We are often paralyzed by number magic and impressed by computer  outputs, but the further we go into the future, the more uncertain things become. Therefore, we should  use a good portion of common sense before we start extensive number crunching operations in order  to try to give a precise cost and benefit ratio on small and simpler projects39 such as SMPs.

2.2.3 Selecting the Best Idea 
Even if the idea of an SMP meets our technical and financial investment requirements, the next aspect  that needs to be reflected on should be whether we have or can obtain sufficient support to manage it.  Unfortunately, “selling” is often done by laypeople perceived to be involved in intrusive marketing. How  wrong can one be! Almost all good ideas have to be sold, and very few are just discovered and become  successes. One basic is the seller’s ability to see him or herself through the customer’s eyes, i.e. from the  outside looking in. After that, what remains is an analysis of the three C’s: Clients, Competitors and  Company. Who will benefit from our project? Who will be our “enemies”? How will the SMP support  the company?

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
What is an SMP 
Both one’s own funds and other sources must be carefully examined and confirmed as much as possible  before an idea is pursued any further. It does not help that an investment calculation shows a large profit  in the long run if the project “dies” because the costs become damagingly high before any revenue has  materialized. In addition, SMPs must also be assessed against other investments. It is very rare in today’s  world that companies and organizations have only one or two projects underway at the same time. It  is far more common to have multiparty projects and multi-complex projects. Multiparty projects are  projects with multiple clients involved such as stakeholders, and multi-complex projects occur when  many projects and programs compete for the same resources in terms of employees, physical resources  and financing. In large organizations, multi-project activities have become so common that they have  become more and more computerized as project portfolio programs calculate the overall use of resources  for all projects in the company, both ongoing and those in the pipeline. The purpose here is to balance  and reduce the number of projects to only the most important ones, the key projects. In this way, it is  easier to calculate the total profitability of a company’s project activity.  
To elaborate calculations of this kind for SMPs can often be both cumbersome and unnecessary. Instead  of risking the killing of a good idea by using meticulous mathematics and probability calculations, one  can come a long way simply by using pure instinct. If many agree that an SMP idea is good, it is probably  good enough to be attempted. As previously mentioned, we can afford to take chances with SMPs. To  take chances on small investments is the degree of freedom that any organization should allow itself if  they want to create something new, profitable and exciting. Some SMPs can simply only be evaluated  against the situation that has created a project’s needs, which can be an immediate crisis that has to be  solved or a golden opportunity that has to be dealt with as quickly as possible. We must bear in mind that  in principle there are two types of knowledge: tacit and explicit. Explicit knowledge refers to knowledge  that is transmittable in a formal, systematic language, while tacit knowledge is personal, context-specific  and hard to formalize and communicate. For this reason, it may be difficult to find a fully explainable  advantage on very short notice. In fact, one should be careful in letting a long-term vision and strategy  prevent us from doing SMPs that obviously need to be done! 
When we invest in a project, the most important part is to reflect on the costs involved, and the costs  should be better quantified to some degree. If the costs are significantly larger than what the company  or we can cope with in the short term, the project proposal should of course be forgotten or at least not  realized for the time-being. Benefits should similarly be discussed, but not necessarily calculated with  extreme precision and justified only from a long-term perspective. Calculated benefits are extremely  important to identify, but as has already been pointed out, a simple “gut feeling” for SMPs can serve as a  good enough reason! As has been argued by many, entrepreneurial success is often an iterative process.40 If business model A fails, then negotiate business model B with the project client or user. For SMPs to  become simpler, iterative benefit-cost evaluations in cooperation with potential project stakeholders are  something a project leader and his or her companions should always strive for.

What is an SMP 
But there are also other important matters to consider. Just because SMPs should not be as seriously  scrutinized as larger projects in principle, there are still other precautions that must be taken. One  practical observation is that some projects such as smaller, reorganizational activities, or the development  of internal systems for increasing efficiency or productivity, tend to only get a high priority in the  beginning. As soon as the project has started, higher level management’s interest slows down and the  project leader suddenly has to struggle with both poor resources and poor attention.41 Conversely,  customer and market-related projects tend to receive an increased priority over time.42 These matters  disturb the internal competition for many SMPs. Nevertheless, the project leader must not give up, as  many SMPs are destined to constantly fight for their priority.  
The conclusion at this point is that certain benefit-cost calculations are obviously important for all projects,  including SMPs, though they must not be too comprehensive and become time- and money consuming  operations. Sound and simple human judgments can mean a lot, which is also the idea behind Stepstone  #1, i.e. to first identify the person(s) who invented the idea; then move on to the next highest level as far  as who really supports the idea; then both our and their opinions about the relevance of the idea, followed  by a ranking between a minimum of five other ideas from which the most current is perceived as “the  winner.” At a very early stage, this will already create a safeguard that the idea is not the only one being  evaluated, but instead is a result of competition. This also takes into account the financial standpoint  in the sense that the approximate implementation costs compared to the assumed benefits at this early  stage must also be an important part of our decision. The Stepstone method also helps to identify those  who may be severe opponents of the idea. A project’s “enemies” will almost always exist and to reflect  on who they might be is another important aspect of an early project selection. 
In this way, Stepstone #1 is just a first, very brief evaluation of an idea. In reality, the Stepstone is itself  a small project or “feasibility study.” The purpose is to ensure that the idea is worthwhile in pursuing.5 If the average score is “5” or better, then the first key decision point or obstacle in the project has been  conquered, even though we can choose to proceed with a lower score. But we should consider the situation,  or at least seriously reflect on those questions that are not satisfactorily answered, and why, if we want  to continue with an idea. For example, if the project leader or main stakeholders have not responded  positively to statements 4 and 6 in the Stepstone, it could be because someone may have forgotten to  compare the idea with other ideas, and also that the project will have to struggle from the start with  serious opponents who question the suggested benefits, the suggested costs, the benefit-cost ratio and  our own involvement. These are threats that are generally not thought so much about in traditional  benefit-cost calculations, but which can play a very serious role in SMPs.

What is an SMP 
Additionally, we should consider how motivating the project idea is after it has been scrutinized in  this way. As mentioned earlier, it has been proven that the motivation within a project may vary in its  development phases.43 In the early phases of a project, it is particularly top management’s support and  the enthusiasm among the project’s key actors that are so important. If it seems as if some of the not-so 
good-answers related to low motivation are already present at this point in time, it is a first signal that  the project idea might be difficult to implement, even if it has technically achieved a “5” or better score. 
It must never be forgotten that we live in a modern culture in which monetary value, after all, is the key  yardstick for success. As a result, we should always strongly draw attention to the economic dimension  of the project. A first warning sign of potential trouble is when the project involves huge economic  disbursements. The result may be that all financial resources are used on only one investment, which  is both risky and threatening and blocks other important investments from being realized. Another  warning sign is that the commitment to the project can set major precedents, which is when actions  and decisions establish principles which perhaps unfairly favor similar projects in the future. A third  important factor to consider is whether the project involves tying up resources in the long term such  as schemes which are difficult to reduce or that prevent flexibility. Another important consideration is  also irreversible interventions, i.e. actions that involve solutions which cannot be eliminated, although  they are later proven to be of low value. 
2.3 Conclusions about Stepstone # 1 
In order to advance to the next Stepstone, one should be able to positively answer five out of the six  statements listed, which is approximately 80%. If not, we better rethink the entire idea or go deeper into  the statement scores to see if something can be changed, redirected, or supported differently in order to  achieve a sound project idea for further development. 
In conclusion, one should not forget the important role of communication. For most of the stated questions,  it may be wise to contact relevant persons in order to check as to which degree they agree with the  answers. Perhaps the idea is not really new to them and has even been tried before with questionable  success? We should be very observant about such basic information and its relevance for our SMP.  
Then comes the importance of motivation. Maybe the idea will face far more resistance than expected  due to reasons the project manager and even key stakeholders do not know about? But if the project  idea is still received very favorably and we feel confident that the motivation is both high and justified,  that the idea is supported at a higher level, and that the effects of the project are satisfactorily reassured  both in the short and long term, then we have received a green light to proceed with the project idea  to the next Stepstone.  
The most motivating aspect will be the challenge of the new and the support felt from both higher level management  and end user(s).

Another very important factor is communication, in that precise data is given within the organization to higher level  management and to the user(s) in a clear and easily understandable form.
	



2.4 Stepstone # 1 Used on the Conference SMP 
A simple method for screening the conference idea at a very early stage is to use the NAF principle. NAF stands for  whether an idea is New, Attractive and Feasible. For the conference SMP, an early NAM analysis can be as that shown  below in Figure 2.4: 
Very little Very much 
0 1 2 3 4 5 
N (How New the idea is) × 
A (How Attractive the idea is) × 
F (How Feasible the idea is) × 
A good rule of thumb is that an average score of less than “4” on the NAF test should make us reluctant to pursue the  SMP any further. According to the marks above, holding a conference like this is not so new so we only give it a “3”, but  we regard it as a very attractive idea and give that idea a “5”, and in our view it is definitely feasible, so we mark it with a  “4”. The reason why the feasibility is not given a “5” is our uncertainty about the number of skilled speakers we can get  and that we are perhaps slightly optimistic about the number of participants who will attend as well. For instance, if we  had given a score lower than “3” on how new the idea is we would need a score of “5” on its feasibility in order to find  the idea acceptable enough for further elaboration. 
When the SMP is to organize a conference, a simple benefit-cost assessment would be to reflect on the extent to which  conference costs are at least offset by the expected market value, the sales potential of the product the conference is  about going to market, and the potential immediate and future earnings as a result of the conference.

2.5 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 2 When Stepstone #1 has justified that the idea seems to be a valuable investment, there are two questions: 
1. Is the project approach the most suitable implementation form for realizing the idea? 2. Will it be possible to find enough resources to run the project?

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
To be able to transform an idea into a project at the outset is no guarantee of success. The project  approach is demanding, and some of the requirements may simply go against the project approach  being the best way. After all, there are quite a few other good ways to solve a problem. Some problems  are more fitted to be solved through traditional routine operations, e.g. complete repetition of previous  operations, which is often both cheaper and faster than creating a new project. This is especially true  when the operation comes very close to a former successful operation. Obviously, it would be easier to  just allocate enough skilled people, agree on the standard of the end product, agree on a well-known  recipe for how to run the operation and get started. The known difficulties have to continuously defend  why the project approach was chosen. These difficulties include the project’s execution process and the  use of scarce resources which have been used to explain why one better operate in accordance with  well-known policies, common rules and established norms instead of embarking into a time- and cost intensive project operation. 
Another way to problem solve is to use the “random approach.”44 By using this approach, we just start  and see how it goes under the motto “the road is built as we walk on it.” If both the end result and the  way of working are relatively unclear, this can help to promote exciting creativity during the operation,  and the end result may be surprisingly better than expected, though of course things can also become  worse. We take chances; we trust our own ingenuity, skills and perhaps a little bit of luck when problems  occur. Still, many masterpieces and many a good product have become great successes just by using this  method of random approach.  
The project approach lies in the way between a routine operation and the random approach. The  more complex and restless a society is, the more we depend upon some type of formal arrangements  since regularities in some dimensions of life make it easier to engage in and cope with change in other  dimensions.45 While the ruling arrangements may be more or less “satisfactory” in terms of how far they  contribute to our well-being, wealth creation and happiness in society as a whole, they will never reach  “optimality” as seen from the point of view of society. We therefore have to accept that even the project  approach is far from perfect for any of us, but its benefits seem to outweigh its drawbacks. 
Still, we have to sell our project well. A crucial factor is whether the project will receive adequate funding.  One must distinguish between benefits and costs, as well as equity and debt. They who help with foreign  capital often require some form of security for their investment. The main types of funding are public  funding, mortgages, leasing, bank loans, venture capital and “Business Angels.”46 All funding sources have  their pages. Public funds often provide favorable conditions, but one is plagued by bureaucratic processes and  frequent reporting requirements. Mortgage loans are often long term and also contain favorable conditions,  but full funding is rarely possible. Leasing means full funding, but the loan is limited to the lifetime of the  object and often comes with a high interest rate. Bank loans are often very flexible, but require security  and limit the freedom to act in one’s own way. Venture capital means high expectations, good support and  access to important business networks, but such capital can be difficult to find and can imply limitations in  ownership. “Business Angels” normally give good terms and tend to have a rich business network, but the  investor seldom involves him or herself too much in the project and also does not give too much support.

Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
It is sometimes possible that the task is larger than a project. It can, for example, be better run as a  program. We want something, but we are unable to concretize what we want as more than a good  direction, a good purpose or a good strategy. Perhaps only certain parts of our program declaration can  be designed as a project or a portfolio of projects, but we have no clear opinion about this yet. According  to theory, one should then use a “stepping-stone” approach, going through five levels of investigation  to see if there are opportunities for good cooperation with other projects, other units and even other  companies. The levels are:47 
Level 0 Planning – At this level, businesses have an understanding that project cooperation is  desirable, and they have come so far that one has started a planning effort. However, a  plan is no guarantee that the work will actually be done, so at this level there is still no  coordination and no common value. 
Level 1 Coordination of work processes – The businesses are able to perform projects that  require participation from both parties which can be as simple as one business performs  part of a project, although this requires information or participation from the other  business to finish. 
Level 2 Knowledge Sharing – The businesses share project knowledge and experience that  enables learning and innovation across organizational boundaries. One creates physical  or electronic meeting places, and one creates an infrastructure that enables the exchange  of knowledge to be made possible. The result is better services for the end-users. 
Level 3 Common value creation – The businesses are developing projects that create new  services for their common users. Together, they create value that would not have been  possible through cooperation at lower project levels. 
Level 4 Strategic coordination – Here, businesses are capable of having a close strategic  partnership toward common project goals and common benefits, and the degree of  socio-economic benefit can be very large. 
These steps are obviously of great importance in today’s situation when many companies tend to  have many ongoing projects at the same time. In this case, it may be much better to seek more in depth information about level possibilities as described above in order to not throw oneself into an  all too uncertain and unhealthy single project operation when cross- disciplinary and cross-business  opportunities can be developed.

Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
2.6 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 2 
A simple way to check whether a project idea is practical is to compare the stated ambition with the  available competence. Obeng48 has launched four possibilities in principle:  
1. We know what we want, and we also know how to apply the project approach successfully,  in which case the project is “closed.”  
2. We know what we want, but we are not sure whether we can master the project approach  well enough to successfully proceed, in which case the project is “half closed.”  3. We master the project approach well, but we are not sure what we will end with so the  project is “half open.” 
4. We neither master the project form nor do we know what the end result will be; thus, the  project is “open.”

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I The options are illustrated in Figure 2.3 below: 
Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
Know What Don’t Know  What

Don’t Know How 
CLOSED 
(”Painting by  numbers”) 
HALF CLOSED ”Going  
on a quest”) 
HALF OPEN (”Making a  movie”) 
OPEN 
”Walking  
in the fog”) 
Figure 2.3 – Types of change projects by Obeng. 
If we more or less know exactly what we want, then the goal of the project is clear. In addition, if we  master the project form we should have enough skill at the outset to run our project successfully.  Traditional project work is typical for this situation. We know what we want and we are staffing the  project with experienced, well-qualified people who match the project’s challenge. The project is “closed”  and the work follows prescriptions as minutely as possible, much in the same way as we fill in colors in  a coloring book for children in which each color is codified by a number. In this way, we end up with  nice, colorful pictures.  
But today, we also have projects where we know the project approach well through education or  experience, though we do not really know what we will end up with. In many ways, it is just like “making a  movie.” It is through observation and experience in the process itself that the most important end product  becomes more and more clear. The way to work however is clear, much like following a “cookbook.”49 
Film producers know how to make a movie, but they are not sure how the end product will be until  they have cut and pasted the final movie. Thus, the project is “half open.” 
Then we have projects where we know what we want, but we are in doubt about how to proceed. The  work process will then be a continuous “search” for how to do it. Even so, the goal, i.e. the end product,  is clear all the time. A consequence may be that we are working hard but inefficiently, and if or when the  goal is reached, it is not through enthusiasm and smart thinking, but rather through exhausting work  and pure duty. The project is “half closed.” 
In projects where we do not know what we want and do not know how to handle the project approach,  we simply “walk in the fog.” Many artists often have this way of working. They are creative and innovative,  but often have a very unsystematic approach, and the end result is not clear until the last day (if ever).  Of course, some of these “open projects” may end up as a unique work of art, while at the same time  the risk of failure is also very great.

Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
Traditionally, it is only the first type which has been regarded as a “real project.” Today, however, there is  a growing understanding that as long as we do not know the future, we must accept that some projects  will start without knowing exactly what the best end product should be. If much of what is happening  throughout the project process shows that the end product will be different than originally thought, the  project process should have the flexibility to change course for the better. A well-known term for this  approach is “to shoot towards a moving target.” Today, it is clear that many projects would benefit from  such a mindset.  
The other two forms of project work may also be relevant, but it is generally more dubious for them to  be called “projects.” If you know what you want but do not master the project principle or the way to  work with a project, there is a good chance that a brilliant idea will be destroyed by bad craftsmanship.  And if we do not know what we want or how to use the project form properly, it is certainly not a project  and could be considered more of a “happening” or a pure random effort that will easily end in nothing  other than frustration.  
A good first step in order to check if the project idea is suitable for the project form is to compare your  effort with the most widely known definition of a project: 
“A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.”50
	



According to theory, this definition belongs to the “task perspective,” i.e. that the project shall create a  result, produce a product or perform a service. The following definitions illustrate the generally recognized  criteria for a task to be defined as a project:51, 52 
1. A project is justified by a recognized need or problem.  
2. A project starts out with a clear goal or goals. 
3. A project has a certain degree of uniqueness which makes routine operations less suitable. 4. A project has, or should be given, clear resource boundaries with respect to time, money and  personnel at the very least.  
There are many appealing elements in this definition. Most people like to be given the opportunity to  really concentrate on a task since our normal working days are usually littered with many unpleasant  interruptions. Projects are for people who are action-oriented and goal-oriented. The definition is also  quite simple, but despite all these advantages the definition embodies a clear conflict between aspirations 
(definitions 1–3) and restrictions (definition 4). This is typical of today’s project challenges; namely, to  master a high degree of creativity and a high degree of restrictiveness at the same time.

Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
The next step is to find the best capital provider. If the SMP belongs to our own organization, we just  have to convince our superiors that the project is worthwhile based on a positive benefit-cost evaluation  and our capability to run the project successfully. If the capital provider is external to our SMP, we have  to be more careful. The best way to start is to create a “business plan,” a working document that provides  clear and concise information on all aspects of the new project that are relevant for the investor. This  includes information about the project’s mission, goal, market, the way the project will be led, benefit-cost  analysis performed, etc. Negotiations with investors are often described as a battle between greed and  caution. On the one hand, we have the fear of not getting the necessary financing, while on the other,  having the desire to not give away too large a share of the project to the investor so that our personal  ownership feeling of the project disappears. It can therefore be an advantage to provide capital over several  steps, even if it means repeating the rounds of negotiation. Significant elements of the negotiations are  reasonably based arguments, our own personal conviction about the project’s success, how mature the  business idea is and that the expected value corresponds to the investor’s expectations. 
With both a clear project definition and the funding clarified, many projects in fact end up as separate  organizations, living only as long as the project lasts. For that reason, this definition can mean that  projects today are seen much like an organization whose mission is to solve a problem for a larger, more  stable organization, generally referred to as the “base organization.”53 The base organization can be both  large and small. Similarly, the project definition does not make a separate distinction between large  and small projects. Therefore, this definition can be regarded as being a general one for any operation  that is decided to be run as a project, and will also be used in this book as a proper way of identifying  project operations. 
2.7 Conclusions about Stepstone # 2 
The next Stepstone is about examining whether our potential project is fit to be executed as a real project.  We do this by using Stepstone # 2, “Turning the idea into an SMP.” Following the same principle as in  the first Stepstone, at least 5 of the 6 questions should be answered positively. If not, there is reason  to rethink the idea of conducting this operation as a project and going back using the arrow between  Stepstone # 1 and Stepstone # 2 as illustrated in Figure 1.3. An alternative of course is to stop further  project development at this point in time, meaning that the project will then be turned down, either  permanently or temporarily. 
In the same way as in Stepstone # 1, motivation and communication will play major roles.  
What motivates the most is about having a good match between competences and challenges. To have the chance  to do something we know we have mastered, particularly within an area that we feel is important, is very motivating.

Stepstone # 2: Turning the Idea into an SMP 
In terms of communication, it is essential that the project is defined in such a way that the project’s objective and  requirements are fully understood by those who shall perform the job. Key project personnel should be familiar with  both the project’s purpose and its terms of reference. This can be done in writing or in the form of verbal communication  between relevant stakeholders.
	



2.8 Stepstone # 2 Used on the Conference SMP 
When the SMP is to organize a conference, an important first step is to reassess whether the conference has a clear  purpose. What do we really want to achieve? If it shall be carried out as a project, then the conference must have some  type of uniqueness and be managed within strict financial, time and quality limits. Is this really important? Perhaps the  way last year’s conference was done can just be repeated? If so, the conference can be run as a routine operation in a  smooth and safe manner. Is it really important to make a precise quality description about the final goal? Perhaps the  entire conference can be run as a creative, ad hoc operation, opening up for learning-by-doing and just deciding the  purpose, as opposed to having a concrete goal that forces people to accept strict constraints? Using the Stepstone as a  means of clarifying our decisions will be helpful, but if we find the best solution is a professional project approach, we  should go for it!

This chapter elaborates on perhaps the most complicated step in a project’s development; namely, to  identify the best project. There are many ways to do this, in addition to many considerations and many  ways to measure “value.” Even if a task is valuable in and of itself, this does not guarantee that the task  is fit for the project approach. This chapter has to therefore be taken in various ways to help identify and  prioritize SMPs, and concludes with a mandatory definition that applies to both large and small projects.

3 How to Prepare SMPs 
How to Prepare SMPs 
 Stepstone # 3: Appointing the  SMP’s Project Leader 
3.1 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 3 
Research confirms that the project manager is the project’s most important person,54 regardless of whether  he or she is called a manager or a leader.55 The first step in the project preparation phase is to select the  person who shall be in charge of the entire endeavor. This is a very important step and should be done  with a keen evaluation of the candidates. It is not uncommon that the person who has come up with  the idea, fought for its justification and prepared the project concept ends up being selected, regardless  of whether he or she has limited or no real project leadership experience. Technically speaking, this  is not necessarily the best choice because project management is a profession no matter the level and  type of project, and should preferably be handled by people who not only have enthusiasm as a driving  force, but also possess reasonable project management skills as their basis. In large projects, the rule is  simply to select those who have already shown themselves to be capable of running projects or similarly  extensive operations more or less successfully in the past.  
Nonetheless, this could be a trap since the competent application of tools and techniques is not necessarily  the most prominent factor for success. In small projects such as SMPs, the situation can very often be  different. It may well be that those selected do not have the highest professional project competence,  though a certain lack of managerial experience can be compensated for with skill in collaboration and  the use of emotional intelligence, as well as the ability to motivate others and make decisions. According  to Furnham,56 the best managers are generally those who are bright enough! That means bright, but not  too bright; skilled, but not too skilled; smart, but not too smart; social, but not too social, and so on.  For SMPs, this is an especially valid view in the selection process of the project manager and leader  who is the best fit.

How to Prepare SMPs 
The difference between a manager and a leader is often discussed, and the most popular distinction is  that managers “follow the rules,” while leaders “make the rules” or even “break the rules” when necessary.  Another definition is that leaders “act”, while managers “react.”57 In project operations, it seems wise to act  as both a project manager and a project leader depending on the type of project, the state of the project,  the people involved and the setting of the project. Their competence, decisiveness and ability to show  both good management and good leadership have a direct impact on a project’s success.58 According to  new research,59 four out of five efforts to change fail because managers instinctively bristle against change.  People tend to continue with what they know best and with what they know works. Human beings have  three barriers in the brain that block change. The first one is a “failure to see” in the sense that a person  does not see the need for innovation and change until things are about to go wrong. The second is a  “failure to move,” which means that it is agreed upon that something new must happen, although change  is still opposed. The reason for this is that often when something new is started, one is not very good  in the beginning. Thus, one prefers to continue with what one knows best. Many managers devote little  attention to this phase, despite the fact that this is where the resistance is greatest. The third barrier is  the “failure to finish,” this being that people simply get tired or lose direction during the transformation  process and fall back on old patterns, with the reason possibly being a lack of follow-up or feedback.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
How to Prepare SMPs 
The question then becomes who should appoint the project leader? In large projects, it is common that  project managers are appointed using the hierarchical principle: Top management or CEOs appoint  officers at the next level, the next level appoints their subordinate managers, and so on. In principle at least,  the selection of the project manager is the responsibility of senior management. Any superior is naturally  welcome to use his/her expertise in this process, but the formal appointment is superior management’s  responsibility. Because the role of the project manager has become an increasingly important position,  it is very important that the appointment becomes quite formal.  
For SMPs, formalities are also important. In SMPs, project managers are also leaders, although the  leadership role is often very difficult since it is a typical middle-management role. In these roles, we have  “leaders” both above and subordinate to us; the latter in the sense that we may have to lead people who  are in charge of specialist groups, special management divisions and the like. Even in very small SMPs, it  is not uncommon that the few people we are leading have special roles and areas that they are in charge  of. The project leader then becomes the linchpin between layers of leaders, which again easily implies  pressure from both above and below, with people above us putting pressure on us for more action and  progress in order to satisfy market demands, customer needs and even supporting higher levels of their  own prestige. At the same time, will skilled people who are subordinate to us voice their demands, their  needs and their opinions? To handle all of this, a good rule is that our coordination activity becomes as  slim and transparent as possible.  
3.2 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 3 
The best practical principle in order to cope with all the demands we will surely face is to have only  one project leader. Both steering committees and other bodies such as advisory groups and reference  boards may well have more members, but project management is a “lonely” job.60 To follow up this quite  complex responsibility implies a need for relevant, practical authority. Project leaders must be willing  to often use power in ways that subordinate managers and other project staff may find uncomfortable  and stressful. Yet, this is the guiding principle in all organizational activity in that the responsibility and  authority are distributed so that some have a greater responsibility and authority than others and shall  be allowed use it. As a result, the rule is that even in SMPs, project leaders will be given high, formal  power in order for them to do the job in ways that match their ability and preferences. One important  difference between a manager and a leader is that a manager often sees a crisis as something to be coped  with, while a leader sees a crisis as an opportunity. 
The typical formal authorities for project leaders of SMPs within the given Terms of References are: 
- The authority to call and organize meetings and gatherings, including those that cost money; - The authorization to purchase equipment and consultancy services when needed; - The authorization to approve travel for staff members, including course participation and  academic excursions; 
49

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
- The authorization to replace and dismiss project workers; - The authorization to order overtime; and 
- The authorization to change the project’s goal or goals.  
How to Prepare SMPs 
In addition, a project leader must use informal power. However, informal power cannot be authorized –  it must be earned – and is created through the attitude and behavior that project managers demonstrate  to their surroundings and their employees. This is a very important factor to be aware of in today’s  knowledge-based societies, in which project leaders are put in charge of well-qualified people who are  often more competent than themselves in specialized areas. By virtue of their knowledge and expertise,  these people will then “lead” in their fields of responsibility, and through their influence they indirectly  “lead” the project leader. For SMPs, this is typical. Key project people are seldom selected by some  haphazard principle. They are selected because they are skilled and competent, but when they are  competent they have their own opinions that can sometimes go against those of the project leader. The  fewer the project staff, the more natural this becomes. Often, the only way to master these situations is  to use informal authority, which is why the modern leaders of SMPs must also learn how to negotiate,  convince and lead in an indirect way in order to maintain the progress of a project.61 
3.3 Conclusions about Stepstone # 3 
In Stepstone # 3, “The Choice of the Project Leader”, these reflections are expressed in 10 questions or  statements, of which the total score should not be less than 8, thus indicating an average score of 80%.  A basic principle of this Stepstone is that if we cannot manage ourselves, we also cannot manage others.  But even if the one intended to be the project leader receives a response rate lower than 8, we can still  consider him or her as being the correct project leader. We should be very careful if the project goal  can be changed if this turns out to be response rate is too low since it is very important that the right project leader be selected as early as possible. To arrive late in the project process, e.g. when the project  is selected, planned and organized by others, can make it difficult for the project manager to make the  proper decisions when unexpected situations arise. In such cases, the person who has participated in the  early processes often has an intuitive feeling for what will be the best decisions and actions. Particularly  as it regards SMPs, it is a good rule to look for people with early initiative and enthusiasm as project  leaders since they will automatically be involved in the early stages of the project. 
As stated, personal enthusiasm in combination with a rich personal network are important for good  communication and high motivation. But if the score is too low, the project leadership role should be  left to others, be delegated or perhaps be at a higher level, i.e. adjusted in an upward direction. Project  leaders who are lukewarm to the task will naturally not put as much effort into a project’s implementation,  and will be keener to use their network of contacts for personal benefit than for the advantage of the  project. An enthusiast will see the project as a personal challenge and use their energy for both personal  success as well as the project’s success. A good motto is to select a project leader who feels “comfortable  in an uncomfortable job.”

How to Prepare SMPs 
Nevertheless, we must always consider the negative answers in a Stepstone. A low enthusiasm for a  project task the way it is formulated at this early stage can be changed to a positive answer with only  minor reformulations of goals and terms. Some weak academic abilities can be strengthened through  training and practice, while a weak horizontal network can be improved through deliberate efforts. The  question of how to motivate others can be learned by only small changes in attitude and behavior. In this  way, the horizontal double-arrow back to the previous Stepstone can be an incentive to change some of  the conditions in order for the SMP and its leader to achieve a better fit. 
Together, motivation and communication related to Stepstone # 3 should be as follows: 
The most important motivational issues are a matter of good problem understanding, great will and great enthusiasm.

3.4 Stepstone # 3 Used at the Conference SMP 
How to Prepare SMPs 


When our SMP is about organizing a conference, the selection of the project leader should be based on the high and  relevant scores from all the questions in Stepstone # 3. The selection should also be based on his or her enthusiasm for  the task, not only on previous experience with similar events. For example, the person selected at the conference SMP  should be a specialist in team building, which would be a good compensation for lower scores on some of the other  items. Perhaps an unconventional choice for the project leader increases the chances for a new and creative conference  solution, while at the same time developing a new and skilled internal project leader for similar events in the future.

Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members 
Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s  Core Team Members 
4.1 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 4  
Although the project leader is a very important person, there are three other important roles within  the project:  
1. The roles of the project’s Core Team members; 
2. The role of the project owner or the project principal; 
3. The role of the project user or project customer.  
In large projects, these roles and responsibilities are carefully described and often confirmed in the form  of a contract, although for small projects they should be agreed on as early as possible. A project leader  must possess a good knowledge of where his/her people come from, what positions they have held or  are familiar with and how they should best participate in the project endeavor.  
The most important element is the people who shall be the project’s Core Team members. They will be  the driving forces in the project, and it is through their expertise and experience that they will participate  in and exert an active influence on the daily work of the project. They can be experts within key areas  that the project needs for shorter periods or be consultants and advisors in special situations. In society,  more and more people will acquire two types of knowledge: “explicit knowledge” and “tacit knowledge.”  The latter is knowledge they may not even realize themselves that they possess, but which appears when  the setting is right. This will take place when the tasks they perform fit well with their accumulated  knowledge or when the team is performing work and operations that stimulate them to make active  use of all their knowledge.  
In this context, it must be understood that a team is not the same as a group. Groups seldom work in  an optimal manner. Research has confirmed that one often invests less personal effort when working  in a group than when working alone, and a group does not need to have common goals or needs, to  complement each other, to help each other or to have a stable membership. A team, however, has to  include all these properties, but must be careful not to sub-optimize or use methods which are too special  or have been put together only to satisfy the base organization. Without any follow-up, a keen use of  authority and sensible delegation, a team can end up performing in a very unproductive and negative  way. This can even happen to expert teams, especially the kind we tend to find in projects. The role of  the project leader is to therefore build a Core Team who performs well together.

Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members 
As for the project leader, the project’s Core Team members should be drawn into the project’s work as  early as possible, despite the fact that both the purpose and objectives of the project may be slightly  unclear at this point in time. But research has revealed that if management gives a project team diffuse  information about its goals and objectives in the beginning, this may well speed up the team effect.  A good team will be eager to start engaging in formulating sensible, creative and ambitious goals. If  higher management later comes back with more precise goals and objectives, the team’s efficiency can  be reduced. Consequently, the project leader should be cautious in presenting the description of an  exact final goal or goals at too early of a stage, as it is better to leave that to a discussion both with and  among the Core Team’s members.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members 
4.2 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 4  
Based on our knowledge of good team composition, it is of vital importance in SMPs that the project  leader be given the opportunity to voice his or her own personal preferences as to who should constitute  the project’s Core Team. A good practical rule to remember is that the core values of an effective leader  almost always also reflect the core values of the project leader’s team members. It is not necessary for the  project manager to be allowed to use all the people he or she prefers the most, but rather to be given the  opportunity to have some influence on the selection process. The reason for this is that people who already  know each other and work well together will perform faster and more efficiently under pressure than people  who must spend a long time on the usual social processes. It generally takes time to build trust and mutual  understanding, and is faster and more efficient to put teams together that already have great confidence in  each other, though this view can of course be controversial for some. The general consensus is that all people  can learn to work well together if we use some time for team building. But because the main purpose of a  project is to reach a goal within strict time constraints, a better principle for SMPs is to select people who  have the greatest chance of starting as quickly as possible in order to achieve that goal together.  
At the same time, the project leader must use common sense in the selection process. Only good,  old acquaintances working together can create a “buddy” effect, thereby slowing down efficiency and  productivity since we do not like to criticize our friends. Too much similarity among the team members  may also be unfortunate because differences in important opinions may be scarce. Additionally, it seems  to be a good idea to mix both gender and age. The number of social contacts and empathy increases  with age, while the tendency to talk spontaneously and the willingness to take risks decreases with  age. Women can often have a moderating and integrating effect on aggressive teams, but can also be  too cautious. Men may be more aggressive and outgoing than woman, but have a tendency to isolate  themselves, particularly under pressure. Personality is just as important as academic qualifications,  especially when the work requires cooperation. According to studies, project leaders often use 85% of  their time on management and only 15% on leadership. If the latter is increased to 30%, the team will  perform better since the leader can then use more time on feedback, praise and individual recognition.  It is also important that the project manager considers the balance between key member’s expectations  and their real competence, which is illustrated below in Figure 4.1:

Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members 
The diagram shows what can happen if the balance is not right. It is the project leader’s duty to find  people belonging to the upper right corner, often called the “float zone.” 
Finally, it is a good rule to select team members who have a high probability that they will be available  until the project’s work is completed. To change team members while the project is underway tends to  lead to social and academic stress. Having to break-up, intervene and regularly update new employees  is time-consuming and frustrating for any project. 
In principle, the project owner is the person or agent who says “go” for the project. Any project has at  least one owner, and in small SMPs the owner and the project leader could even be the same person.  The owner’s primary role is to ensure that the project’s purpose is valid all the way through until the  project’s implementation and conclusion. A natural part of this role is to allocate the project’s financial  terms and determine the desired quality of the end product. The owner can delegate this authority to a  specially appointed steering committee, a project office, a project coordinator or the like.  
The project’s user or client is another important consideration. It is the customer who has to live with the  end result of the project, and it is the usefulness of the end product that determines the user’s opinion  of success. Even so, in some projects the clear identification of the client can be diffuse. For example, in  a large public project the client is “the society,” and a concrete user response is difficult to measure. In  other projects, the “user” is many organizations who have created common projects, some of who are  subordinate to others, making the real user difficult to identify. In SMPs, however, it is very important  that the customer is identified and becomes the one who is the most satisfied. If we as the project’s  executors are very excited about the final product, while the customer or client is dissatisfied, we have  misunderstood the purpose of our project. 
4.3 Conclusions about Stepstone # 4 
To ensure we are doing this part of the project preparation in the best possible way, Stepstone # 4,  “Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members,” is recommended with the same guideline that at least a  score of 8 should be achieved in order to yield a positive response from us. 
The most important motivational factor with this Stepstone is that the SMP,s immediate surroundings  support the project. If we are worried that the project will be dissatisfactorily received due to a blurred  user or client, we very often start to use energy on self-protection instead of using it to achieve the  project’s goal.  
The communication at this point in time must be quite extensive. All participants in the project should  be fully informed about the project’s purpose as well as the expectations of the project’s stakeholders.  Meetings, gatherings, memos and web information are all important tools in this respect.

Stepstone # 4: Appointing the SMP’s Core Team Members 
In conclusion: 
The most motivating factor is the individual team member’s confidence with regard to their own capacity in relation to  the project environment.
	



The most important for good communication is formal and informal communication upward, forward, beyond and  within the project.
	



4.4 Stepstone # 4 Used for the Conference SMP 
When our SMP is a conference, we have to consider both “downstream” and “upstream” activities. For the project’s Core  Team members, mutual trust and respect for each other is more important than having heavy and “recognized” expertise  during the project’s execution. In addition, it is safe to have the right people and agencies at a high level as support  agencies.

Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the  Mission and Goal for the SMP 
5.1 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 5  
Throughout the processing hitherto, the project’s concrete content should be becoming more and more  clarified. Although in principle it should be the clients or users who decide the purpose and terms,  it is not uncommon for users to not have an exact picture of what they really want. Often, they only  have an idea of their desires, which is common in both private and public projects. It is believed for  example that they want a particular result, but it often turns out that there is recognition or prestige for  the individual stakeholder underneath the surface that is attached to the result. Therefore, it will always  be useful to put a desire into a larger context. This simplifies the assessment of what is both important  and less important, and helps to facilitate the choice between perhaps more than one project objective  and those that seemed sustainable and “obvious” in the beginning. For this reason, it is not uncommon  that the project’s objective or underlying purpose must first be thought through. After all, the project’s  goal is only a means to achieve the project’s mission or the project’s “effect goal.” Market analysis, user  analysis and quality assessments should generally be used to broaden the perspective to include the  users’ views. In connection with larger projects, we also know that impact assessments are society’s  formal instrument to enhance the social perspective, and it is essential in the early phase to measure a  project’s potential. Today, it is a tradition that the assessments in the early phases of a project are more  of a “downstream” analysis of the consequences of a project’s execution than an “upstream” assessment  of alternative concepts in relation to the project’s real mission. 
When one turns to the project’s goal(s), the target-seeking nature of the project approach has also led  to great demands on precise descriptions and definitions of those goals. Differences in opinion among  project stakeholders may prove to be rooted in different viewpoints and different definitions.  
Below is a simple model for perhaps achieving a better conceptual clarification of the connection between  the goals and missions as illustrated in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1 – Relationship between goal levels in SMPs. 
Before the project begins, we have a vision, a dream or prophecy that makes it important to do something  about the future. The higher up in the hierarchy of management we go, the more it is assumed and  expected that they have a vision that can be communicated. On the basis of this vision, the purpose of  the project is described, which tells us why the project is so important. The purpose is the backdrop for  the project’s TORs, which must be set so that is possible to achieve the goal of the project within these  terms. The final goal of the project then ultimately describes what the project result is expected to look  like. Together, the TORs and goal form the project’s objective, which is to reach the goal within the TORs.  The concrete portion of the project’s planning, organizing, etc. is something that starts immediately after  the project’s objective is determined, and the project is completed when the goal is reached within the  project’s TORs. This can even happen if the original project goal (s) is not achieved, e.g. if an adjusted  project goal is agreed upon during a project’s planning or execution. Still, the basic principle is that one  should be allowed to adjust or redefine project goals that do not collide with the project’s TORs. 
It is natural in the initial planning process to bring together the project’s Core Team members, though  it may be discovered that the objective of the client and the project team differs. To develop a product  that offers high economic returns may seem quite an attractive objective, but an equally important one is  to raise the company’s image over the longer term. It may also be that being too greedy provides short 
term pleasure, while it destroys the company’s reputation and survival in the long run. Similarly, some  believe that the project’s purpose is to create a technically more efficient control system while the real  purpose is better customer service, something which may require some “time-lapses” in our service work  in order for the company to be allowed to spend more time and effort on making its customers happy.

Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
It is advice worth taking that the client seeks the support of key people in this work. Managers at higher  levels can also be drawn into the process of determining project objectives since these objectives need to  match corporate purposes, which again should support our vision. We should not forget that in smaller  projects we often tend to be primarily occupied with performance goals and objectives which are relatively  short-term perspectives. This may well be a correct standpoint, but if such is the case, this purpose must  be clearly reflected in the goal formulation of the project. Larger projects and public projects will often  have more strategic “effect goals,” thereby making projects more justified from a long-term perspective.62 Even if that is also important for smaller projects, the long-term perspective should not be so overriding  that the value of the short-term delivery is forgotten. Simply said, the project’s goal tells “what” we shall  reach in the end, while the project’s mission tells “why” it is so important to reach the goal. Because of  this, the project goal is not a process, but instead is a situation. In practice, we already have visions and  purposes, while the goal is something we make.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
There is every reason to take the process of formulating a project’s objectives seriously. Although the  project goal can be changed if this turns out to be sensible as the project work progresses, the goal  and mission for any project should be a thorough and serious discussion among the centrally involved  stakeholders. Some good reasons for this are: 
- A good project goal gives legitimacy, that is, it justifies why one’s work should be hard and  determined.  
- A good goal creates image, that is, it proliferates the project’s organization and participants.  - The goal setting process clarifies attitudes, that is, it reveals what we are for and who is  against what. 
- The goal setting process clears up possible conflicts – the target “cleans the air” and leads the  project towards working on the right track. 
- The goal prompts reward. When we achieve our goal, we find it reasonable to receive a  reward that is conceived to be greater than what was required to achieve the goal in the first  place. 
An important problem when entering this process is that we may well discover that the participants and  stakeholders not only both have multiple or compound targets, but conflicting goals as well. It is easy to  want both high quality and low costs at the same time, but high quality normally also implies high costs.  It is also easy to move into a broad democratic decision-making process, while at the same time quick  decisions are of the utmost importance. But since democracy takes time, the result may well be a slow  decision-making process with many discussions and hearings. This type of process is highly democratic,  though very time consuming. In fact, this is the classical dilemma between equality and efficiency.  
When these conflicting goals occur, various goal selection methods can be used in order to find the real,  underlying goals we are aiming for. Under Heading 5.4, a practical goal selection method is shown, ending  with a prioritized list of goal statements. This list will then serve as an important input for deciding a  project’s success criteria, which will be treated in more detail in Chapter 5.  
After the goal or goals are set, the next important step is to decide the TOR for the project. This is a  description of the boundaries that the project’s work are not allowed to exceed, although this is not  necessarily the same as the project’s budget, schedule or the end product’s quality. These dimensions can,  if necessary, be determined later as a result of planning. The TOR are different since they tell us which  constraints we have to operate within. For large projects, this is often the most important negotiation  phase between a project’s superiors and participants. It is these types of boundaries that we find in  project contracts, in which mutual, often legal obligations are specified. These agreements are of vital  importance for all parties to understand and agree on because they set the standard for the work and the  trust between the parties; in other words, how this is formulated strongly influences both the motivation  and communication in the project’s execution phase.

5.2 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 5  
In principle, it is the client who decides the TOR for the SMP. But when it comes to execution, we allow  more freedom in SMPs than in larger, more complex projects. The reason for this is that the original  visionary agent can be the project leader him/herself. If both the progress and goals stay within the  agreed TOR, the project leader and the project team should be given enough freedom to use creativity  and flexibility in improving the project’s development process. A typical TOR could be that the project  work should not take more than one year. This means that any completion date that takes less than one  year is fully acceptable and there is no reason to reduce the cost and quality for the sake of a shorter  time period, though if it is easier and just as beneficial to accomplish everything in less time then of  course this should be done. It is up to the project leader to make that decision, although using more  than a year is unacceptable. Similarly, one TOR could be to not use more than 12,000 Monetary Units.  A lower cost consumption of course is welcome, but should not be a precept in much the same way that  the project has a quality frame with a special ISO-specification, meaning that achieving a better quality  than expected or planned is excellent, although the mandatory condition is only that the quality should  not be less than the specified standard. 
For many SMPs, the TOR contains enough information for leading a project towards its goal. In principle  at least, that implies that the project leader is delegated the freedom to act and decide within a given  framework and is not directed on how to use project resources in detail from superiors. However, if  further detailed planning is requested by all parties, this should obviously be done. One example of this  would be an agreement about a more accurate budget, a more precise deadline or a more precise quality  description. Nevertheless, the main principle in SMPs is that detailed plans shall serve as guidelines and  not as a prerequisite! In fact, the project leader should have the opportunity to fully re-plan the project  if he or she finds this to be important, as long as the new plan does not violate the TOR. 
The TOR and the project goal are closely connected, which is illustrated in Figure 5.2:    
Figure 5.2 –The principle of the “Moving Target” for SMPs.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
As illustrated, the TOR can only be modified by a project’s principals, and the project goal can be  changed within the agreed framework by the project leader based on what he or she is experiencing  and recognizing in the ongoing project process. Therefore, the formulation of the project’s mission and  goal(s) must be decided at an early stage, and the goal must be designed so that it yields both good sense  and good progress. Consequently, a goal is more than a description of an end-state. A good SMP goal  should also be desired and an inspiration since everyone knows how much easier it is to work towards  a desired goal than a goal that is forced upon us. 
A number of recipes have been developed over time on how good project goals should be formed from  the identification of the goal’s “hard” features (quantifiable, result-oriented and realistic) to the “soft” or  “process-oriented” features (simple, individual and motivating) characteristics, to using acronyms such as  SMART63 (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), to Stretching, Motivational, Action 
oriented, Result-oriented, and Trackable). The following four criteria have been particularly stressed as  prerequisites for achieving strong goals for a team: that the goals are common and create a common fate,  that they are simple and concrete, that they stir passion, and that they place competition on the outside.64 
The most important thing is that it is possible to measure when the goal is reached, which implies that a  bad project goal could be to “earn more money,” while a good project goal is “to earn 12,000 Monetary  Units,” or “at least 12,000 Monetary Units.” By doing things in this way, we can check to see if the goal  has been reached. Simply making “more money” is not good enough, because in principle it could be  anything from 1 Monetary Units to 1 million Monetary Units. Close specifications are not only good  for a mutual understanding of what is requested, but will also disclose possible disagreements and  misunderstandings among key stakeholders, including the project staff. In doing so, we can avoid later  trouble when team members discover they may have completely different opinions on what should be  the goal, thus emphasizing the old adage “promise less, deliver more,” perhaps encouraging an even  better attitude – to deliver more than expected. 
5.3 Conclusions about Stepstone # 5 
By using Stepstone # 5, “Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP,” we examine if the objectives  and TOR for the project are good enough. At least a score of 8 should be achieved in order to be good  enough.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
As previously stated, this is the belief and understanding of the goal and purpose of the SMP among  Core Team members that guides the communication and motivation in the project. It is especially  important that the participants feel that the TOR are acceptable. This means that there must be a  reasonable consistency between the quality requirement of the goal, the financial limits and the allotted  time within which the project’s work is supposed to be completed, although this is not the same as the  quality specification, the concrete project budget and the exact time the SMP will take to complete. In  the future, such precise definitions and concrete planning will be taken care of if necessary. At this point,  it is the outer borders we are concerned about, and it is the degree of freedom for the project leader and  his or her team to act that is set.  
In addition, please note that the project’s objectives can be different depending on the project being an  upstream or downstream project. Many SMPs are just pilot projects to larger projects, and a pilot project  normally has the aim of investigating whether a later, main project should start or not. The resulting  master project may then need to commit more concretely to the final product or result. In addition, the  main projects can be small- and/or medium-sized and could well be treated as SMPs.

Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
In conclusion: 
The most important factor for good motivation is to believe in the purpose of the SMP and that the goal can be reached  within the TOR.
	



The most important factor for good communication is discussing the project’s goals, mission and TOR with all of the  project’s Core Team members.
	



5.4 Stepstone # 5 Used for the Conference SMP 
When describing the purpose of the conference, we start with the mission. In our view, an appropriate mission is to  promote our company by making it well-known, trustworthy and popular among both old and new clients and even  the general public. Through this mission, we believe that our company will be better off in the future and attract more  customers in order for us to have a sustainable financial development. 
An appropriate TOR is that the conference should be held this year, not cost more than 12,000 Monetary Units, attract  at least 500 important visitors and be implemented with a quality that satisfies the attendees. 
When it comes to the goal of the conference, the purpose is to design a goal(s) that supports the mission. At the same  time, the goal must be attainable within the given TOR. It may well be that there are several opinions on what is the main  objective for this conference: the management would probably want as many visitors as possible; the people responsible  for the finances would probably prefer a conference that was as cheap as possible; the marketing people probably want  the highest possible quality for the conference and the most attractive brochures; professionals want the best speakers;  and the project manager wants an effective and rapid implementation and monitoring system, both before and during  the conference, as well as some type of reward for arranging a conference that everybody regards as a success. 
To decide which objectives should be given priority, there are many ways to do this. As previously discussed, we could  decide which SMP to go for in terms of pure imagination and have an open discussion among our stakeholders, or we  could throw the ball to top management and ask them to decide on the objectives without our intervention. 
Yet another option would be to use the “Matched Pair Method,” which is a handy method for many SMP-type projects.  When using this method, we list all desired SMP objectives in a matrix as shown below in Figure 5.3. In Step 1, the  objective “Many participants” is first compared with “Cheap conference.” It is suggested in the matrix that the financial  people win, as the majority of the Core Team people agree that economy must come before quantity, realizing though  that many participants means a really nice income. On the other hand, will many conference participants imply more  arrangement costs? In the matrix, the decision is to let the financial people win this first comparison. The winner is now  compared with the next objective which is “Quality.” Since the primary purpose of the conference is to promote our own  organization, this objective is now agreed to be the winner as marked in the matrix. The new winner, “Quality”, is now  compared with next objective, “Attractive brochures.” In this comparison, “Quality” wins. We assume that we can achieve  a high quality for the conference without using expensive and fancy brochures. “Quality” is subsequently confronted  with the next objective, “Highly skilled speakers.” Of course there are some dependencies here, but if we can keep a high  quality for the conference without having to bring in the most attractive, and probably most costly speakers, the winner  will remain a “High-quality conference.” Finally, the conference quality is compared with “Effective implementation,” and  “Quality” wins again, as a technically efficient implementation without a good quality for the conference is not intended.  The final winner after this is, “High conference quality,” or simply, “Quality.”

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 5: Deciding on the Mission and Goal for the SMP 
The conference now has the following final goal statement: 
“The main goal of our SMP is to arrange a unique conference, demonstrating a high implementation quality by using very  attractive conference speakers. To the extent possible, the conference shall attract at least 500 visitors through the use of  appealing conference brochures, which will demonstrate how we are able to effectuate good conference professionalism  while maintaining low budgetary costs.” 
As stated, the main goal was extracted from the two objectives which were given the highest priority through the chosen  selection method. The other objectives are added as desired, but not stated as imposed requirements. The objectives are  naturally related in the sense that effective implementation depends on the staff’s motivation, while attraction depends  on appealing brochures, etc. It is important that the project’s goals only be measured after the project is finished. In this  case, we can only measure goal fulfillment after the conference has been held.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution  in SMPs 
6.1 Theoretical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone # 6  
The purpose of modern organizational activities is work distribution and cooperation. Some will have to  be responsibility for activities, while others will have decision-making responsibilities. In large projects,  clarification of this distribution is a very important part of the project organization because there  are a number of actors who are of importance when organizing them. Typically, it is steering groups  or committees, advisory groups, external contacts, suppliers, political actors, competitors and other  institutions and companies that have a stake in a project. In this way, it may be that many individuals  and groups need to be involved in many different ways in the project endeavor. A common name for  all these agents, whether inside or outside the project, are Stakeholders. Per definition, stakeholders are  individuals or groups that directly or indirectly influence, or will be influenced by, the project’s work  and its results.65 
All daily decisions are certainly the project leader’s responsibility, although a project may come into  an unexpected situation in which decisions have broad, strategic significance and where the project  leader’s knowledge and expertise are not broad enough. In order to remedy this situation, the project’s  superiors can appoint a special Steering Committee. In principle, steering committees are supposed to act  on behalf of the client and have superior decision-making authority in the project. Membership follows  the “top-down” principle. It is management at a higher level than the project leader who appoints the  committee representatives. The Steering Committee has the same basic responsibility as the project leader  for making the project a success, and like the board of directors in a company, it must intervene and  take responsibility when necessary. It is important to be aware that research has shown a low correlation  between success in projects and the extent of operational involvement of the Steering Committee. Instead,  the project leader can be told to follow or confirm decisions with the Steering Committee in order to  ensure that the project makes appropriate policy decisions. 
One person who is involved in a role that is recognized as being more and more important in many  projects is the Project Sponsor, who is the person that directs the staff. He or she is the manager within  the base organization and is not directly involved in the operational work of the project, but can oversee  a project, delegate authority and provide support as a trainer or coach to the Project Manager.66 The  Project Sponsor should have sufficient authority over the project and receive the cooperation of key  stakeholders. One important duty is to ensure that the project is aligned with the organizational strategy  and compliant with the policy of the project’s base organization. In larger projects, there is often frequent  contact with the Project Manager so as to better monitor the project’s effectiveness. Depending upon  the initial setup of the project, the Project Sponsor can also chair the Steering Committee, approve final  deliveries and communicate about the project both inside the agency and with external stakeholders.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
Another important role is the project secretary. In small projects, it is not uncommon that the project  manager uses 50% of his or her time for administrative tasks. To charge the project leader with heavy  administrative work, as well as demanding good professional leadership and management can be a  heavy combination. As a result, he or she often succeeds in none of the areas, and the project fails. The  solution is to then appoint a project secretary, at least on a part-time basis. Another solution may be that  the base organization establishes a project office with a project director, whose responsibility it is to take  care of the necessary administrative support. Such an office or agency is also very appropriate when an  organization has many projects and programs at the same time and needs someone to take care of the  coordination and prioritization of the complete project portfolio.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
Another area that can be significant in many projects is to have good advice along the way. In large projects,  such advice can be given by special Advisory Boards, Reference Groups or Expert Groups. But again, one  should be careful of appointing too many additional bodies in connection to a project. Bureaucracy will  always take its tolls, and the best way to proceed is to use the Responsibility Map described below as a  good background in relation to the need for separate advisory groups. If the Cooperation Chart contains  a lot of required consultations, this is a signal that the project leader better seek quite a bit of advice.  To smooth out this process for the Steering Committee, project superiors must appoint representatives  to such a group. But one should always reflect on the possibility of instead including some key experts  in the project team in order for the project to already have the necessary expertise on board. A third  possibility is to include special training sequences in the project plan, making the project team more  and more self-sufficient and thus less dependent on external advice. The latter will extend the project  time and cost of the project, but can be a good investment in internal skills development in the long run.  
For large and complex projects, these roles for various project actors are supposed to be described in  detailed organizational charts in much the same manner as for an entire company or organization.  Command lines are determined, the hierarchical principle clarified for most of the decisions and the  key jobs clarified as minutely as possible.67 Extensive delegation is normal for such a large project  organization to function well. 
To help out this process today, one uses special project decomposition structures such as a Work  Breakdown Structure (WBS). This is a technique that involves breaking down the project in key areas  in such a way that the work can be divided into separate, important sub-disciplines such as important  administrative areas, important system development areas, important Areas of Responsibility in  construction projects, etc. The purpose here is to define various sub-areas, with each of them serving  to make important contributions to the project’s goal and objectives. In large projects, such WBS maps  can be quite complicated. The maps should not only identify important areas, but also how these areas  are intertwined. The maps show both horizontal and vertical dependencies, e.g. relationships to sub contractors, users and others.68 
When we then start to decide which organization may fit the project best, we distinguish between line  functional project organizations, matrix organizations and independent project organizations in large  projects as illustrated below in Figure 6.1: 
72

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
Figure 6.1 – Illustration of the three main types of project  
organizations in relation to their base organization. 
The triangle represents the base or line organization and the circles the three major types of project  organizations. In the first case, the line-functional organization, the project is completely within the “line”  of the base organization. The project leader and his or her team perform project work in the same way  as normal line operations. The only difference is that the tasks they do are defined as a project.  
In the matrix organization, people are equally divided between the project and the base organization,  and the project staff is drawn into the project as needed. At certain times they do project operations,  while at other times they do the line work, etc. The matrix can be “weak,” implying that the project staff  is sitting in their line functions throughout the full project and doing part-time jobs in the project at  specific intervals, or “strong,” meaning that the staff is pulled out of the line to a common meeting place,  a common office or the like 100% of the time they are working on the project.  
When the project is “independent,” all project staff members are pulled out of line on a full-time basis  to a common meeting place or office for as long as the project lasts. They are 100% project staff, and  need only report to the project leader. 
Today, the matrix form is the most popular for use in modern project endeavors, though it is the hardest  to master. It is popular because employees will have a more varied work schedule with both line and  project duties at the same time. The form also utilizes human resources in a better way. Studies have  pointed out that projects located within the line have the lowest project success, while the matrix form  scores the highest. One reason for this is that the line is built by using a bureaucratic pattern, and in  principle bureaucracies are built to cope with the predictable, not the unique.69 Another reason is that  there is a positive correlation between the project’s success and the project leader’s authority. In line  functions, project leaders often have to accept that almost all authority rests with their own line bosses.  Since true authority must come from below and not from above,70 it can be difficult to exercise enough  authority in demanding situations when staff knows that the real authority rests at a higher level.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
In this context, the matrix form is better because the project leader’s authority tends to be clearer, while  at the same time the form enriches each individual’s social and professional contacts. The problem of  the matrix form, however, is that the workload can be more complicated than envisioned71, 72 – especially  if employees participate in many projects simultaneously, i.e. becoming “multiproject workers.”73 Most  project plans are made for “good weather,” and when the project encounters problems, it can be difficult for  individual employees to simultaneously prioritize between line work and several projects. This problem  can be further amplified when the project manager and his or her team have more than one boss. In  theory, having several bosses is an interesting solution in “good weather.” When we have many higher  level people who know us, our chances of recognition and promotion increase. Although in “bad weather,”  the situation can be both stressful and often almost impossible for us to properly master. When several  higher level managers need the same project staff member at the same time, it goes without saying that  a person cannot make copies of him or herself, and the solution is impossible. Finally, it also seems that  the matrix form is the easiest to fall back on when solving urgent problems. Personnel are not full time  and can still handle at least one more task, although the consequence could be that an organization is  fooling itself by increasing its project portfolio far beyond what it has the human resources to manage.74 
Perhaps the most important thing for the project’s organization is to clarify the relationship with their  base organization. In theory, the difference between a line organization and a project organization is quite  clear. The base or line organization has a responsibility to resolve ordinary, ongoing tasks. It generally  performs routine tasks adapted to a hierarchical structure and has fixed communication lines.

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
The project organization establishes communication lines and ways of cooperating that fit the project  situation.75,76 It has a responsibility and way of working that fits the project’s size and complexity, and  priority is given to simple and fast decision-making processes. Still, a project must be careful not to be too  “flexible.” The importance of the external can easily be overestimated at the cost of internal functionality  and needs, and project organizations must have rules and structure.77 
In addition, a project can have several base organizations. A municipal project, for example, can have  the municipality, county councils and private interest groups as clients. A private project can similarly be  created in an alliance among several companies, as together they often have all the resources the project  needs. Even so, the same rules apply and a project organization must form its own way of solving the  problem and reaching the goal. 
6.2 Practical Reflections behind the Statements in Stepstone #6  
In SMPs, the choice of a formal project organization is less important.78 With fewer people involved, both  communication and decision-making can go faster because we do not need to follow as many formal  channels. The easiest way to divide the labor is to have the project leader make all administrative decisions  about the project, discussing with his/her key employees when an interdisciplinary understanding is  needed and who delegates responsibility for the quality of the performance to qualified project staff.  Formal delegation is rarely necessary.79 As a rule, it is better to let the team organize itself the way  members themselves prefer.80 
But even though this may seem simple and logical, the reality can be far more complicated. When  resources are limited, can line managers be confronted with the risk that it is expected that they will  perform the same number of tasks as before, albeit with fewer resources? Not without reason, this can  create conflicts. This is a classic problem any project organization will face when theory confronts reality.  
In large and complex projects, this is solved by precisely designed contracts and agreements between  the parties. Often, these projects are staffed with external people, making the line less affected, while  consulting firms and individual experts are typically available on the open market. 
In SMPs it is quite common that the staff is recruited for shorter or longer periods of time directly from  their own line organization. In “good weather,” this is not a problem. We agree on forms of cooperation,  and staffing is flexible enough for both project and line tasks to be handled in a satisfactory manner.

Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
It is in “bad weather” that the practical problems occur, so it is wise to have a few practical rules that  take effect when the need arises. Some usual, practical rules for organizing SMPs are: 
1. The Cooperation Chart is agreed on as a guideline for when resources from the line  organization shall perform project work.  
2. That a pre-appointed authority, such as a Steering Committee or a special high level manager,  decides if and when the base organization’s resources shall be given to the project if conflicts  arise. 
3. That the project leader has full authority over allocated resources for as long as he/she is the  head of the project. 
4. That the project leader has the opportunity to reward individuals for well-performed work  beyond the line organization’s normal remuneration. 
5. That there is a “force majeure” clause in the agreement that specifies what the project leader  can do when serious, unexpected situations arise that can potentially destroy the project’s  progress and value. Such an agreement must be established at the highest level, normally at  the CEO or client level.  
In order to master all this, it is important for SMPs to create “dashboards” that show how the various  stakeholders depend on each other. This is not so much for the overview as such, but in order to maintain  a good basis for the distribution of authority and responsibilities among key people in the execution  phase. This must of course be balanced with the situation both within and outside the project. What  is important is that the project team works so well that the goal is reached without unnecessary, time 
consuming formalities. That does not mean that formalities are unnecessary in SMPs, but that it is the  informal lines of responsibility that may need to work best. To a limited extent, SMPs are therefore  concerned with minute job descriptions and formal organization charts. While traditional organizations  are usually concerned more with how to manage than to renew, renewal is the main purpose for the  organization of SMPs. The key word is not instruction, but cooperation.

Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
A good way to find out how to best handle central stakeholders in SMPs is to construct a Stakeholder  Management Matrix, as shown below in Figure 6.2: 
Those who have little  possibility to influence  your project 
Those who have a great  ability to affect your  project 
Those who do not have  too much interest in  your project 
These stakeholders  normally demand  
limited follow-up, but be  aware of their  
existance. 
Keep these  
stakeholders very well  satisfied! 
Those who have a big  interest in your project 
Keep these  
stakeholders very  well-informed! 
Treat these  
stakeholders as your  closest buddies!

Project Leadership – Step by Step: Part I 
Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
The matrix is based on the principle that the most important thing is not whether the organization  works well from a technical viewpoint, but rather if the people work well. For the knowledge worker,  an important keyword in this context is empowerment. The ideology behind empowerment is to create  social processes that increase people’s ability, whether alone or together with others, to solve problems  and mobilize the necessary resources so that they achieve control over themselves and their level of  performance.81 For such a purpose, special Cooperation Charts82 have been developed for projects. For  SMPs, these maps will replace the more elaborate WBS diagrams83 commonly used in large and complex  projects. Nonetheless, the principle is the same; namely, that the individual project participants shall  cover their areas of responsibility through a reasonably clear description of their role.84 
Many of the stakeholders above belong to the lower right-hand corner “your closest buddies.” In addition  to the project Core Team, here we also find line management, users and important local authorities.  They have a vested interest in our SMP and can also exercise great power and influence in the project’s  work. In practice, one should treat them on an equal footing with the project’s internal key personnel.  We should cooperate with them, consult with them and inform them, so they are constantly aware of  the status of the project and consider what it means for them. 
Other stakeholders belong to the parts of the matrix with a “big interest” in how the SMP is doing, but  who have “little possibility to influence” the project. Both friends and family can be in that category. In  any case, it is important that they are kept “well-informed” about any progress so that they can better  understand what the project is doing and why. Be aware that this group can suddenly acquire power,  which they may use in an unpleasant way if they have felt previously mistreated. 
In the group with little interest but large power, we find parties that are relatively distant from the SMP,  but who have great power and can use it to both the project’s favor and detriment. This is typical of  distant senior management, credit institutions, banks, local and central authorities, politicians, hostile  labor unions, special groups and eloquent individuals. The key words are to “keep them satisfied.” Let  your credit institutions be well-informed about your sound use of the money borrowed from them, tell  the authorities that the rules are being followed, allow the unions to participate when important decisions  are discussed, inform activists and allow active individuals to have the opportunity to voice their views.  
In the matrix, we also have the group consisting of bodies that have little influence and power over the  project. They may be personal acquaintances, watchers or gray-zone competitors. Although one would  like to cultivate one’s acquaintances, it is a good rule to use a minimum amount of effort in taking care of  them. Project leaders will probably have enough to do in managing the other three stakeholder groups.  The extra effort we use on this group can lead to less effort towards the more central groups, which  certainly need a lot of attention.

Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
To master all of this in a constructive and effective way, we use “Cooperation Maps” as simpler versions  of responsibility charts. For SMPs, these maps should have a maximum of six roles: 
MD = The Main Decision Maker  
MT = The Main Task Executor 
MC = They who Must be Consulted 
MI = They who Must be Informed 
PC = They who Perhaps shall be Consulted 
PI = They who Perhaps shall be Informed 
The first four roles are more or less mandatory in any modern project, but it is of primary importance  in SMPs to keep formal bodies to a minimum. The easiest way to find out if our SMP requires extra  organizational units or not is to use a Responsibility Map for the project, later illustrated in Figure 6.3  as the reference. If the project leader (MD) in this map has the overall responsibility for decisions for  the majority of the responsibility areas in the project, it is probably unnecessary to form a Steering  Committee. If, however, agencies above the project leader have a lot of the main decision responsibility  and the project manager has the most task executing responsibility (MT), we should consider appointing  representatives from clients and users to form such a committee. Since a steering committee automatically  involves one more body to administer, one should soberly consider whether the need is great enough.  Perhaps it will be enough for just a support person, a “project champion” or a similar higher up in  the project hierarchy to make important, overarching decisions when necessary. Or we could replace  the Steering Committee with an Advisory Board (which we tend to find as an additional body to the  Steering Committee in larger projects) that has no decision making authority over the Project Leader,  but is supposed to provide insight to the team regarding stakeholder interests, technical advice and other  relevant initiatives.85 
The purpose of the last two roles, PC and PI, is to allow for the possibility that if at the start of our SMP  we do not really know if expert help will be needed for specific tasks later in the project, then such  expertise can be linked to the project on an option basis. That is, as the project progresses, we assume  it will become clearer as to whether we need special expertise or not. If the answer later is that we can  seem to manage without this expertise, we will contact the person who was the intended expert within  a relevant time period and tell him/her that there is no need for their services, thereby exercising our  option to reject this resource. Nonetheless, if we should need expert help after all, we will bring that help  into the project team for the necessary amount of time. By doing so, we simply strengthen our staff as  needed. Similarly, we may choose to inform or not, depending on how the project develops. Obviously,  it is important that these persons or groups will be properly informed in advance and asked if they are  willing to have this potential role. For that reason, one should consider pulling them in for discussions  quite early in the project process.

Stepstone # 6: The Role Distribution in SMPs 
The total number of roles normally involved in SMPs is as follows:  
- Top management;  
- Line management; 
- The users of the project results; 
- Local authorities at the place the SMP is being physically executed; 
- Media, activists, owners and researchers; 
- The project leader’s personal network. 
Top management consists of stakeholders who are particularly important. They will be able to intervene  and will have great power. It should therefore always be taken into consideration as to how they should  be connected to an SMP’s work.86 
Line management is the agency that initially has the work power the project needs, subsequently reducing  the line’s work capacity. If the reduction is extensive, or creates technical problems for line management,  this can create a negative attitude from line stakeholders, often with serious consequences.  
Users are obviously an important stakeholder group. They will live with the results that the project brings  forth and will naturally give their reaction if this does not match their expectations. In order to satisfy  them, they may need to be pulled directly into the project’s work in a sensible way.  
If the project work is done at a particular geographic location, local instances often have an impact. They  may be local authorities, politicians, licensing agencies and loan agencies such as banks, landowners  and neighbors.  
Today, media and activists are major forces in modern society, and positive or negative attention in the  media can strongly affect a project’s success. It should be expected to be profiled in newspaper articles,  news reports, television features and on the web, and researchers can promote controversial views,  whether legitimate or only for the sake of attention.  
It is best not to forget the project leader’s personal network such as family, friends, acquaintances and  business associates. Family may dislike the project leader’s long working hours and ruined weekends,  while friends can lose touch or competitors can use information to the detriment of a project.  
Although all these agencies mean that the Cooperation Chart can be quite extensive, a good rule is to  limit it to one A4 page. The reason for this is psychological. The A4 format has a special visual appeal.  An A4 sheet is easy to handle, it goes easily into our inner pocket and it provides a quick overview and  understanding.87 The Cooperation Chart provides both a practical overall plan and a “Master Plan,” and  is suitable as part of the project’s main contract which defines the project’s scope.88
