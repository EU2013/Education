Navigating through change
in 2023 and beyond
For the past few years, HR leaders
have been tested in unprecedented
ways. We’ve had to focus on resolving
numerous challenges ranging from
the abrupt shift to remote work to an
onslaught of mass resignations. We’ve
struggled. We’ve adapted. As Reward
Gateway has aptly said, 2022 has been
the year of “The Great Adjustment,”
and as we head into yet another year
of unknowns, we’re being faced with
a set of new challenges, such as quiet
quitting. But what does that really
mean, and how do employers face this
amid a wave of other challenges?
“I was a quiet quitter until I became an
actual quitter,” someone emailed me,
asking to share her story anonymously
on social media. As she chronicled
her transition, her decision was not
instantaneous but a cumulative effect
deeply rooted in management issues.
The world of work has changed
dramatically in recent years and will
continue to evolve, and as HR leaders it’s
critical to keep our employees engaged
and understand how best to adapt to
new landscapes as they come our way.
I am Brigette
Hyacinth, an
international
keynote speaker,
bestselling author
and thought
leader on HR,
leadership and digital transformation.
For over 15 years, I have been advising
HR leaders from all over the globe on
how to unlock creative potential and
increase productivity, while improving the
employee experience and wellbeing. I have
been ranked in the Top 100 HR Influencers
for the last 5 years consecutively. Most
of my career has been dedicated to
putting the “human” back into human
resources. It’s a joy to see leaders I
have worked with adopting a humancentric approach in their organizations.
It’s an absolute win-win situation.
In this research conducted by Reward
Gateway, we can see that 24% of global
employees reported they are no longer
going above and beyond their specific
responsibilities and/or schedule. This
statistic is alarming and quite concerning
and makes it clear that we need to do
what’s within our control to flip the
switch from disengaged to engaged.
Brigette Hyacinth,
international HR and
Leadership thought leader
This report discusses five key
strategies that will help to counteract
employee disengagement. It provides
valuable insights, practical tips
and resources that HR leaders can
immediately incorporate into their dayto-day practices.
Let’s face it, no one joins a company
and thinks, “I will give the bare
minimum.” Disengagement is caused
by a combination of factors, but at the
heart of it lies a manager’s relationship
with their employees. Managers account
for 70% of the variance in employee
engagement. As described in this report,
the recipe for engagement includes
many key ingredients and, if diligently
applied, can lead to success. It’s time for
managers – and employers as a whole –
to use the human-to-human approach.
Take the time to listen. Get to know your
employees, meet them where they are
and be flexible. Show that you care. We
need to be respecting employees and their
experiences. Your employees are your
most valuable asset. Don’t take them for
granted or treat them poorly. Remember
that loyalty is indeed a two-way street.
As companies continue to rely heavily
on HR as a strategic partner to tackle
challenges, it’s important to adapt to
successfully drive change and add
business value. We’ll see many of these
trends listed in this report continue to take
precedence and evolve as organizations
hone in on employee experience.
This report discusses five key strategies
that will help to counteract employee
disengagement. It provides valuable
insights, practical tips and resources that
HR leaders can immediately incorporate
into their day-to-day practices.
In everything we do, the “human
touch” makes the difference.
Sometimes it’s the little things we
do that count the most. It doesn’t
cost much to show employees that
you genuinely care, but it can make
the biggest difference in keeping
them loyal, happy and engaged.
The upcoming year will
undoubtedly present
new challenges for
HR professionals,
but not all hope is lost.

Introduction
Talent planning amid chaos
Seizing opportunity for HR
leaders amid a constant
avalanche of change
Attracting, retaining and engaging
employees in your mission has never
been easy, but today’s workplace
hurdles and global issues are
compounding the strain. Rising
inflation. The great resignation.
Intense competition for talent.
The post-pandemic remote and
distributed work environment.
Employees struggling with physical,
mental and financial wellbeing. Even
your top ambassadors are having
a tough time cheerleading amid
morale issues and disengagement.
In today’s environment, building a strong
and engaged workforce can seem like a
distant summit only reachable along a
path strewn with hazards. It can be easy
to give up on adequate preparation for
the journey ahead – through long-term HR
planning – and just remain in ready mode.
But if Reward Gateway’s bi-annual
survey of global employees is any
indication, now’s not the time to back
away from the challenge. On the contrary
– your employees need you to step up,
and this report will show you how.
Our employee engagement experts have
synthesized the results of our survey
of over 3,000 employees throughout
the U.S., UK and Australia, and gleaned
invaluable insight for HR leaders to boost
engagement in this volatile environment.
And if we can draw one conclusion
from our findings, it’s this: Thriving
in this new world of work demands
a different way of thinking about
our responsibilities as HR leaders.
It will take an utterly new approach
to employee engagement: a radically
human-centered and practical approach
that supports people in ways we never
imagined possible even a few years ago.
The easy-to-implement strategies you’ll
discover in this report will help you stop
current issues in your workplace from
snowballing, gathering momentum
and triggering an avalanche.
How top companies are engaging talent
In the face of today’s ensemble cast of workplace challenges, it’s hard to know where
to begin. This report by Reward Gateway’s employee engagement experts can help.
Based on years of listening to employees and helping HR leaders build winning teams,
our team distils our latest survey results into five easy-to-apply but powerful strategies
focused on boosting engagement – strategies that can catalyze massive changes in
engagement and create a stronger, more passionate and committed workforce.

#1 Treat managers like they
matter, because they do
For years now, our research has
shown that, after fair pay, the
top employee “must have” is
a manager who cares. And for
the vast majority of employees,
feeling heard by leadership is
important to wellbeing at work.
Being seen and heard – simple, human
needs that should be easy to fulfil – so
often get overlooked in the crush of
everyday tasks and stresses. But focusing
on these fundamental needs can be an
elegant, human-centered solution to
create a super-powered workforce.
How can you establish and strengthen
direct employer-employee connections
to ensure staff is heard, engaged, and
contributing to a thriving business?
At Reward Gateway, we recommend
starting with an awareness of how
engaged employees really are. We’ve
created a simplified but useful employee
engagement quadrant that describes
the four main types of employees.
“The very backbone of your company,
managers drive success by steering,
empowering and listening to
employees, all while maintaining
that vital connection to leadership
and vision. It’s critical for companies
to support that cornerstone role.”
Rob Boland

The spectrum of engagement from detractors to ambassadors can be wide
indeed. The good news is that leaders have it in their power to move people
within quadrants, positively influencing detractors and stayers, and helping
grow go-getter loyalty to create a workforce strong on ambassadors.
Quadrant of Employee Engagement
Managers can become invaluable links in the engagement chain
by communicating and connecting employees’ roles back to the
organization’s mission, listening and keeping the pulse of the
front line, and through impactful, relevant people programs.

wellbeing as the heart
of engagement
Up until very recently, wellbeing benefits
were nice-to-haves that only very
people-focused companies offered.
Even then, the benefits remained fairly
surface-level, like wellness seminars or
a gym membership. But in a very short
period of time, with the confluence of so
many emotional, physical and financial
health challenges, wellbeing has gone
from a cool sideline to what should be
the very core of an HR department’s
people strategy, and a fundamental
focus for business leaders everywhere.
“Wellbeing has leveled up. And if
you don’t pay attention to it, you
won’t get the staff loyalty you need
to thrive as an organization.”

Despite the prominent need for workplace wellbeing,
it’s clear there is glaring room for improvement. With
so few employees feeling they have the support they
need at work, HR leaders can help their company stand
out from the crowd by offering excellent and relevant
physical, emotional and financial wellbeing support.
In the pandemic aftermath of stress, burnout and financial
strain, any amount of wellness help, advice and practice,
such as free resources or benefits that strengthen the
pillars of wellbeing, can only help unravel these complex
and often interconnected challenges to help develop
a stronger, happier and more resilient workforce.

Don’t let
employees drift into
disengagement
Strategies for 2023 1 2 3 4 5
“Like reigniting a stagnant relationship, sometimes you just need to go back and
remind employees why they loved their jobs in the first place. Talk to them about
how their talent and energy fuels your organization’s values and mission, and
how that tough day at work was just a hurdle on their way to a higher purpose.”
Rob Boland
#3 Don’t let employees
drift into disengagement
What’s the impact of unchecked
and untreated people challenges?
In short: disengagement.
Employees are forgetting why they
come to work, or why they even took
the job in the first place. While this
apathy can foreshadow a resignation,
it can also evolve into quiet quitting, in
which employees stop bringing their
creative and intellectual best, and most
certainly do not go above and beyond.
For some employees, disengagement
serves as a wake-up call to recalibrate for
balance, maybe through a job change,
a holiday or a leave of absence.
But for the most part, it’s possible for
leaders to re-engage staff who are
simply drifting. Missing this opportunity
risks higher attrition and employees
stepping away from important tasks,
both of which can cause more work for
colleagues, catalyze a burnout domino
effect and lead to a productivity drop.

The four Rs to re-engage your workforce
Moving your quiet quitters into a better quadrant
Revive
Remind
Recharge
Recognize
Ask your employees why they loved
this job enough to accept it. We all, of
course, need a paycheck. But your staff
likely had a choice, and your recruiters
probably inspired the heck out of them
while closing the deal. It’s worth it to
pause regularly to go back to basics, to
communicate your journey and mission
as an organization, and to make sure
your team members know why and how
they’re a critical part of that success.
In every work environment, but especially
in high-stress professions, lightening the
atmosphere can help employees take a
step back and enjoy their work life more.
Relaxing enhances creativity. Think
about it: how many great work-related
ideas come when we’re not at work or
in front of a computer? It’s important
for managers to let employees carve
out their creative time and to take the
lead in reminding their teams that work
doesn’t always have to be serious.
In the crush of everyday deadlines, it’s
easy to forget what work provides. Besides
reminding employees of all the benefits and
supports available (which you hopefully
have!) it’s also important to elevate work
beyond the paycheck. Your workplace
is a rich community of like-minded
professionals with interesting challenges
and ample opportunities for advancement –
a place that will let them grow as a person,
evolve as a professional and develop
relationships with friends and colleagues
– but only when they see it that way.
We can’t forget the fourth, arguably
most important “R”: Recognize. Our
surveys have shown time and time
again that thanking and rewarding
employees for their hard work is
absolutely fundamental to engagement,
which is why we’ve devoted the
whole next section to recognition.
Making sure we have the best possible tools in place to effectively
communicate with our teams is really important, especially as the
majority of our staff are based in our homes and work shifts. We are
embracing the digital age, to ensure staff can quickly and easily find
out about what’s happening in the business and share information.
Jayne Hennessey, Head of Human
Resources at Borough Care
How your employees
may be feeling
right now
Antidotes to these negative emotions
Underappreciated
Offer ongoing positive feedback, recognition
and rewards to make sure employees know
their contributions are appreciated.
Undervalued
Ensure jobs continue to interest and
challenge employees, and that they receive
proper compensation as roles evolve.
Disconnected Regularly communicate to employees how their
talents and contributions matter to the business.
Ignored
Listen, embrace and respond to ambitious
employees who suggest new ways of
working or seek a promotion or raise: you’re
cultivating future ambassadors and leaders.
Isolated
Provide wellbeing support and encourage
face-to-face collaboration and social
interaction among employees to battle
the disconnection and detachment caused
by modern work environments.

Use recognition as
a hidden power
Strategies for 2023 1 2 3 4 5 #4 Use recognition
as a hidden power
“Why am I even doing this?” It’s
easy for employees to feel lost at
work when they’re not recognized
or even thanked for their work,
whether outstanding or simply the
day-to-day, nose-to-the-grindstone
output. This futility can lead to stress
and – left unchecked – burnout.
In 2020, an estimated 76 million cases
of anxiety and 53 million cases of
major depressive disorder across the
globe were attributed directly to the
pandemic.1
 There’s a scientific basis
for this suffering. Isolation and lifestyle
changes have actually altered the brain
chemistry of people around the world,
causing drops in dopamine, serotonin
and oxytocin levels. And that same
biochemistry provides the foundation
for simple interventions that can strike
at the heart of these issues, including
recognition, purpose and connection.
“Recognizing employees and
peers for good work is not
just about being nice. It’s
about being restorative.”

A full 60% of US employees want their
employer to increase their investment in
employee reward and recognition. This
can include providing simple ways to:
• Reward employees for
their contributions
• Send thanks or kudos to employees
and colleagues for great work
• Encourage fun or work-related
competitions and challenges
• Acknowledge and encourage
expected behaviors at work,
such as following important
safety protocols
And why not? For relatively low output,
investments in reward and recognition
pay off, resulting in surprisingly high
boosts in workplace wellbeing and
mitigating negative feelings before
they grow into problems or crises.
Our people feel empowered
to recognize and reward
others across departments
and everybody – from
frontline employees to
our leadership team – is
bought into it. People not
only know that recognition
makes others feel good, it’s
also helping to improve our
business results because our
people are more connected,
more valued and know
that their work is making a
difference. There is power in
listening to and recognizing
your people.

Organizational Development

We have over 1,200 employees who represent multiple generations and

provide a high level of care and support to our residents and their families.

#5 Stay agile to absorb change
Despite the urgent need to attract, retain and engage employees,
many factors – from inflation to budget cuts to competition
for talent – are interfering with long-term planning.
When planners are faced with so many unknowns and blind spots, agility can be a
powerful tool. But only 28% of US HR leaders say their employee engagement strategy
allows them to adapt extremely quickly to the needs of employees as they change.
“A flexible and multi-faceted HR engagement tool can

both the financial and human costs of adoption.”

How can HR leaders gain more agility?
For starters, by listening, anticipating,
and staying open to new approaches.
While keeping the pulse of employee
sentiment, morale, issues, and needs
is important in any work environment,
it could not be more critical today.
And because leadership can’t be
everywhere at once – especially with the
post-pandemic distributed workforce and
so many HR leaders reporting budget,
staffing and other pressures – simple
online solutions to bring HR closer to
the front line are becoming more and
more essential. A full-service employee
engagement platform lets companies:
• Connect employees, managers
and leaders in an authentic way
• Encourage employee connections
through sharing, group
activities and recognition
• Keep everyone informed about
and engaged in company
news, mission, and vision
• Keep your finger on the pulse
of employees so you can quickly
pivot to respond to their needs
As we’ve seen in this report,
the recipe for engagement
includes many key ingredients.
An engagement platform that
responds to your needs today and
tomorrow – from communications
to rewards, recognition and
benefits – can be as flexible as
your planning needs to be.
Climb the engagement summit: together
It’s no exaggeration to say that work
life has changed dramatically over
the last several years. The lasting
impact of the pandemic, remote
work, and rising inflation have shifted
our thinking in significant ways.
Employees now expect a more flexible
work environment, more help with their
financial life, and more honesty about
– and support for – wellbeing issues.
Today’s workplaces are a far
cry from yesterday’s archetypal
faceless corporations where
employees were treated as just
another input to production.
In the face of the pervasive chaos and
anxiety many employees are grappling
with today, wise HR leaders are called
upon to get ahead of these changes
before your workforce quietly – or
even actively – disengages from your
mission and you find yourselves without
effective teams to fulfil your vision.
Affordable and very usable platforms
exist for employees, managers and
leaders to connect and support each
other in a variety of ways. Embracing
recognition, rewards and a comprehensive
approach to workplace wellbeing can
only stand to create stronger, more
productive, and more resilient cultures.
At Reward Gateway, as we’ve
watched workplaces evolve and
taken the pulse of global employees
over the years, we’ve learned
this simple fact: the best way to
prevent stress, disengagement,
and attrition is simply to be
an employer that cares.
