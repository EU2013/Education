Organizational theory in perspective 
1 Organizational theory in  perspective 
Since Mr. A.P. Møller founded this business, 
decency, integrity and trustworthiness 
have been in the heart of the company, 
and I venture to assert that in the A.P. Møller Group, 
there always has been and still is high morals and ethics. 
We have never had and still do not have written rules. 
And we are not planning on having any. 
Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller  
The above quotation from Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller expresses some of the reasons why the company  has come to serve as a model for many when it comes to the ability to manage and organize a company.  The company is based on a number of standards which indicate what it perceives as right and important:  
• Focus on the company – in contrast to focus on the individual 
• Consideration – in contrast to hasty decisions or exaggerated caution 
• 100% rather than 99.9% as we can always improve 
• Take small risks at the risk of failing – rather than risking everything  
• Make usage of abilities for the benefit of the company – rather than keeping knowledge to  yourself 
• Create confidence in the company – in contrast to performing actions that create distrust • Be visionary – rather than having a lazy attitude 
• Dress code – rather than jeans and sweaty hands.  
All managers in the company have attained technical qualifications through a kind of apprenticeship,  which corresponds with Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller’s own type of employment in the shipping company  at the age of 19, and subsequent training in the group, including stationing supplemented with long-term  education at an institution of higher education.  
Previous managers in A.P. Møller still use their experience in management and organization from the  headquarters in their new jobs. Many managers state that Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller is visionary, awe inspiring and perceptive and at the same time a straightforward manager who communicates directly  and “kicks the ball” when employees are sluggish.

Organizational theory in perspective 
His 90th birthday did not put a full stop to his career. There were no signs that his active career would  end then, and his work to improve and develop continues.  
There is room for improvements in the management and structure of many companies and organizations.  Everybody talks about the need for innovation, but according to opinion formers, many companies have  not succeeded in being innovative.  
Three frequent mistakes in managements and organizations are: 
1. Management and organization are too self-satisfied 
2. Management and organization do not master the process of change 
3. Management and organization underestimate the significance of vision 
In a knowledge society, companies are challenged by technology leaps, slides in values and globalization.  Heavy demands are placed on the management and the organization: Both radical, innovative thinking  and disciplined action in response to challenges.  
Too much self-satisfaction can be a large barrier in taking up these challenges. Sources of self-satisfaction  are e.g. unconcerned management, staff ’s ability to deny facts, organizational culture, lacking performance  feedback from external sources, internal assessment systems, organizational structure, low performance  standards, too many visible resources, and the absence of a large, visible crisis. These challenges place  demands on future organizations. Self-satisfaction may be the greatest obstacle in taking the first step  in the process of change.  
Furthermore, management is becoming more important and more difficult than earlier as organizations  are becoming more important than production equipment. It is no longer enough to invest in new  technology, and implement effective production processes. Many companies can do that. It is about who  is the best, when it comes to mobilizing the organization’s energy and individual talents and controlling  the necessary challenges.

1.1 Requirements of future organizations 
Future organizations must be capable of changing relative to a quickly changeable world. Future  organizations are characterized by:  
Characteristics 
	Requirements
	Perceived need for change 
	The maintenance of this perception requires information systems  which communicate results as feedback, e.g. customer satisfaction  and accounting figures.  
Open and honest dialogue about results and working methods. 
	Cooperation at the top 
	No person – regardless of talent – can manage the necessary  changes alone. Management teams are used as they have a  stronger basis for changes than one manager. Individuals, who  have influenced the management earlier, but who spoil teamwork,  are replaced by cooperative managers. 
	Both leadership and management 
	The traditional manager, who plans, budgets, organizes, staffs,  controls and solves problems, is supplemented with a manager  who can create and communicate visions. 
	Proactive work to become future winners 
	Sitting boxes for management which include both leadership and  management
	Ability to implement changes 
	Broadly based competence development in the staff group  contributes to a thorough implementation of changes. 
	Excellent short-term results 
	Delegation of management which provides short-term results  indicating that the vision is on the right track.
	Structure facilitates changes 
	The organization is structured without unnecessary  
interdependence creating inflexible structures and power  concentrations, which prevent changes from being implemented.

1.2 Levels and perspectives in organizational theory 
My experience in working with organizational analyses is that they tend to become too extensive. It may be  relevant to include relations to society and the influence on and from other organizations. And naturally,  there are also relations between the organization’s own teams and individuals. Thus, an organization may  be viewed from different angles. In order to limit the organizational analysis, I recommend Scott’s1 three  levels of analysis as a starting point:  
Social-psychological level – focus on the individual and interpersonal relations.  
Structural level – focus on the organization in general and its subdivisions into organizational entities  containing departments, teams, etc.  
Macro level – focus on the organization as a player in relation to other organizations and society. Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Organizational theory 
Organizational theory in perspective 
The diversity of isolated theories within organizational theory may be related to these levels of analysis.  The earliest organizational studies were based on the social-psychological level, e.g. Mayo’s Hawthorne  studies2. On the basis of early studies by Max Weber, the structural level became widespread, e.g.  Lawrence and Lorsch’s Contingency Theory3. After that, organizational theories were supplemented  with studies at macro level. Currently, I am extending Scott’s analysis levels, giving special attention to  organizations’ learning, which is perceived as the critical success factor in the organization’s adjustment to  the surrounding environment. Today and in the future, any organization needs broadly based competence  development in its staff group as it contributes to thorough implementation of changes. Conversely,  production is limited away from the macro level. For a total presentation, see “Strategy in Successful  Companies”4, chapter 3 as an alternative. In this context, organizational theories are considered with  emphasis on the socio-psychological level, the structural level and on organizational learning.  
Each organizational theory has its primary perspective which Scott5 subdivided into rational, natural and  open perspectives. In this presentation, a distinction is made between these three perspectives through  three primary areas of focus for a given organizational theory. 
• Focus on performance of tasks 
• Focus on motivation 
• Focus on adjustment to the surrounding environment

1.4 Chronological outline of organizational theories 
Personally, I have often needed an outline of the chronological development in organizational theories.  Not least because there are so many applicable theories which solve part of the organization’s task, but  there is no single theory which explains the entire area of analysis and development of organizations.  I have not found it earlier, and therefore, I have made a chronological outline containing significant  contributions to organiza-tional theory over the past 100 years. See figure 1.4.

Focus on task performance and structure 
2 Focus on task performance and  structure 
The greatest contributions to organizational theory have been collected and called “focus on task  performance and structure”. In terms of time, these contributions were made in connection with the  build-up of the industrial society and the great industrial groups, which created a need for theories  about the management of many people gathered around industrial tasks. The large industrial groups  were characterized by being instrumental collectives designed to achieve specific objectives with a  strongly formalized culture. The development resulted in organizational theories with normative6 rules  for structuring of work, where the organizations were instrumental, or machines were constructed for  the purpose of reaching a determined objective.  
In the following, we will review four different theoretical contributions, which are central to the  understanding of organizations that focus on task performance and structure. In the rational perspective,  we also call these contributions theoretical schools: 
• Taylor – Scientific Management 
• Fayol – Administrative Theory 
• Weber – Bureaucracy and Organizational Structure 
• Simon – Administrative Behavior 
Although the schools differ, they share the perception that a formalized structure is prescribed behavior  for the staff ’s common behavior. This rational approach is based on:  
• Transparency to enable consequences of organizational choices to be assessed  • Adjustability for the attainment of maximum production 
• Need for the possibility of replacing parts of the organization and avoid key staff • Need to reduce infighting in order to maintain achieved positions 
• Top-down management and control 
• Professional and rational behavior without disruptive emotional relationshipsDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com

2.1 Scientific Management – F.W. Taylor 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Scientific Management originated in the beginning of the 20th century, and Frederick W. Taylor7 was the  primary contributor. Scientific Management was based on an idea of systematization where attempts  were made to enhance the efficiency of procedures to best effect via scientific analyses and experiments.  Taylor believed that it was possible to prescribe the processes that resulted in maximum output with a  minimum input of energy and resources. Thus, Taylor’s starting point was the individual work process,  which had considerable consequences throughout the system. The structure had to be adapted to the  focus that was put on work processes, and in doing so; the manager lost his governing role as he was  subjected to scientifically calculated solutions. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a staff of specialists  who were capable of determining the optimum work processes. Since the employee and his handling of  work processes was the starting point, Taylor’s approach is categorized as a bottom up approach.  
Scientific Management was quickly adopted by large mass-producing industrial companies. Henry Ford  is the most outstanding example of what is characterized as the ‘industrial revolution’. From studies of  time and carefully determined educational skills, cars were now constructed by mass production in fixed,  machine-like procedures, which created a new ism – Fordism.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Hence, Scientific Management has had a decisive and long impact on the industrial practice and on the  theoretical ideas of organizations in general. Later on, the theory was criticized by both employees and  managers as scientific time studies disregarded their own common sense and judgment. As a result of  this resistance and the spread of other views of humanity, Scientific Management is no longer prevalent  as a managerial ideology. However, it still functions as a guideline for technical procedures, not only in  the industrial sector, but also in the service sector.  
2.2 Administrative Theory – H. Fayol 
Around the same time as Taylor, Henri Fayol8 developed another approach within the rational perspective,  which inverts the focus of Scientific Management. Now, administrative processes rather than technical  processes were rationalized. The administrative principles in the form of the management’s hierarchical  pyramid structure were to function as the basis of the part of the organization that involved activities,  i.e. a top down approach.  
Although Fayol’s thoughts appeared at the beginning of this century, they were not widespread outside  France until 1949 when his studies were translated. Several different theoretical contributions to this  administrative approach are concerned with two overall principles, viz. coordination and specialization –  which have more specific underlying demands: 
Coordination: Hierarchical pyramid 
• All employees are accountable to one superior only. 
• A superior can only have the number of subordinates which he or she can manage (limited ‘span of control’) • Routine work must be performed by subordinates so that the superior can attend to special tasks.  Specialization: Distribution of activities in working groups 
• Formation of homogeneous groups according to:  
• Purpose (Marketing or development department) 
• Process (Typing, punching out beer bottle caps) 
• Customer (Large, medium and small customers) 
• Geography (Different service according to country or region)
	



Figure 2.1: Coordination and specialization 
Thus, coordination is based on a hierarchical pyramid structure in which the members of the organization  are linked to each other, and there must be clarity in the administrative structure. Specialization, on the  other hand, is concerned with ways of grouping the organization’s activities most effectively in separate  entities or departments. This is referred to as the principle of departmentalization where homogeneous or  related activities are grouped in one entity. As it appears from both coordination and specialization, they  express a high degree of formalization, which is one of the principal themes of the rational perspective. 
Fayol and others were pioneers in the creation of administrative theory, and therefore, they were later  subjected to severe criticism for over-simplifying administrative conditions. The main critic was Herbert  Simon who will be discussed below.

2.3 Bureaucracy Model – M. Weber 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Max Weber is described as the father of sociology, and he has made great efforts to elucidate conditions  in Western civilization. He developed an understanding of bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is fundamental as  it represents a basic pattern which exists in many variants.  
Weber is different from Taylor and Fayol in that he has a broader approach to organizations as he includes  the social and historical perspective. He believes that the understanding of organizations and their  structure can be found in the historical context, and he develops a normative ideal for bureaucracy, which  is reflected in his view of e.g. the public employee. According to Weber, the public employee must act as  if the superior’s interests were his own and thus stay in his bureaucratically assigned role9. Bureaucracy  must consist of neutral professional public employees so that the organizational hierarchy can function  as smoothly and effectively as possible. Weber established a number of criteria for bureaucracy:  
According to Weber, bureaucracy is: 
“A specific administrative structure, which is based on a legal and rule-oriented authority” (Scott, 1998: 48)  …and has the following characteristics: 
Established distribution of work between the members of the organization 
• An administrative hierarchy 
• A rule-oriented system, which describes the performance of the work 
• Separation of personal possessions and rights for the office 
• Selection of staff according to technical qualifications 
• Employment involves a career

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
When these criteria have been fulfilled, the organization can be described as the bureaucratic ideal type. 
Additional to the emphasis on the hierarchical aspect of obedience, Weber perceives goal-rational action  as the optimum form of behavior. Acting goal-rationally is an ideal approach, which considers goals,  means and side effects. These three factors must be weighed in relation to each other; means in relation  to goals, goals in relation to side effects, and finally, different possible goals in relation to each other. In  doing so, factors of emotion and value are not included in decision-making but are underlying rationality  perceptions with a lower degree of rationality. The fascination with goal-rational action is also expressed  in Weber’s different perceptions of authority:  
• Traditional authority. Based on historically created legitimacy where authority is hereditary  and based on dependant subordinates. 
• Legal, rule-oriented authority. The bureaucratic type of authority, based on normative rules  for career, hierarchy etc. 
• Charismatic authority. The personal authority, based on a type of ‘seduction’ and hence, the  devotion of supporters.  
Weber’s thoughts are based on demands on the individual employee from an assumption that the  individual employee cannot escape the apparatus in which he is fastened. The philosophy is that the  professional public employee is linked to his position with his entire material and ideal existence, and  hence, the permanent nature of bureaucracies arises: 
The individual public employee cannot escape the apparatus in which he is fastened. Contrary to the notabilities (elite  persons) whose honor position or secondary position is administration, the professional public employee is linked to  his position with his entire material and ideal existence. In most cases, he only functions as one single, specialized part  of a mechanism working restlessly, which prescribes him a march route, which is fixed in everything that is important.  Entrusted with specialized tasks, this mechanism cannot ordinarily be actuated or stopped by him. This can only happen  when it is ordered from the top management.  
Furthermore, those who are managed can neither do without a bureaucratic management instrument, which actually  exists, nor replace it, as this instrument depends on education and specialization and on the employee’s readiness to  handle rehearsed single functions, which are mastered to perfection, and which are joined in a well-planned synthesis.  If he discontinues his work, or it is inhibited by force, the consequence will be chaos, and it is difficult for those who  are managed to improvise a replacement for mastering this chaos. This applies just as strongly to public and private  administration. To a greater extent, the material fate of the masses depend on still more bureaucratically arranged  private capitalistic organizations to function continuously as they should, and thus, the possibility of disengaging them  becomes increasingly utopian.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Max Weber considers the formal structure as a tool for reaching different goals. This perception is still  the hypothesis of many structural analyses, both for practitioners and scientists. The simplified hypothesis  may be arranged in the following way: 
Strategy Formal  structure 
Activities and  
implementation Result 
Figure 2.4: Structure as a link between strategy and implementation 
In a chain like this, the formal structure will assume a very central position. Its job is to translate the  strategy for the organizational level. If the management makes serious mistakes win this translation, it  may be difficult to reach the goals set by the management.  
Weber works in great detail with causes for establishing hierarchical structures, and among the main  causes, he emphasizes:  
1. Hierarchy is caused by size. The spontaneous tendency to cooperate and coordinate, which is found in small  systems (family and other small groups), fails when a larger number of people must work together. Even though  the tasks are not very complicated, a vertical segregation of duties will develop. Implementers, who distribute  tasks, regulate, coordinate, reward and punish, will occur 
2. Hierarchy is caused by complexity. This thesis may be called the specialization thesis. When the tasks and/or  the technique are complex, a vertical segregation of duties will develop. The complexity will require expertise,  planning, coordination and control. Specialists will constitute an important part of the hierarchy technocracy.  
3. Hierarchy is caused by internal and external conflicts. Organizations in an environment, which is characterized  by competition and conflict, need a centre for decision-making, which can make quick decisions and put  them into practice. Furthermore, there will always be a need for a hierarchy, which can solve internal conflicts  concerning objectives and means.  
4. Hierarchy is caused by people’s need for management. Spontaneous coordination will always be vulnerable,  but managers create stability around goals and means in organizations. Abstract programs are rarely inspiring,  but people can identify with managers. Today, this thesis can be found in part of the literature about management  and culture. Good managers create strong cultures.  
5. Hierarchy is caused by class struggle. The production facility will always be the main stage for class struggles,  which may take many shapes. A struggle over the right to manage and distribute work takes place. Through  mechanizing, automation and planning, the staff’s control of the work is reduced. This transfers power resources  from the horizontal work process to the vertical structures.

2.4 Organizational structure 
On the basis of Weber’s thoughts about organizational structure as a link between the company’s strategy  and implementation of action plans, the following models for organizational structures will be discussed: 
• Simple structure 
• Hierarchical system 
• Functional organization 
• Product organization 
• Matrix organization 
At the end of this section, advantages and disadvantages of the models will be assessed. Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Organizational theory 2.4.1 Simple structure 
Focus on task performance and structure 
The simplest type of hierarchy is found in small companies where the owner participates in the work.  Coordination takes place spontaneously; there are no levels between the owners and the employee(s).  Many employers want top managers who are assigned certain contact and supervision tasks and serve  as substitutes for their employers during vacation and sickness. This type is called the simple structure10.  
2.4.2 Hierarchical organization 
When the organization grows bigger, a hierarchical system will develop as shown in the figure below.  The hierarchy may serve many different purposes in the organization, but often, importance is attached  to authority and the right to make certain types of decisions. Earlier, when analyzing hierarchies,  inspiration was derived from military systems, hence the concepts of line and staff, which appear in  many organizational analyses. Line is referred to as a chain of command in military terminology.

2.4.3 Functional organization 
The functional organization has some obvious advantages, but it also has large disadvantages. The  expertise in the organization is centralized and enabled to develop further. This will also involve a kind of  cultural homogeneity: People have the same academic background, they use the same technical models,  and they perform tasks within the same function. All these factors are seemingly fine, but the problem  is that the different professional groups distinguish themselves, distance themselves from each other, do  not understand each other and easily come into conflicts with each other.

2.4.4 Product organization 
Product organization is a significant form of organization today. It is particularly useful in organizations  with clearly separated product groups or services. Quick changes in competitive conditions and  technology cause great advantages for this organizational form in preference to functional organization11.  The advantages of product organization are that the specialists in the organization are able to focus on  one specific product group and make quick decisions. Also, the final result will also be much clearer  than in functional organization where responsibilities are often volatilized.

The above mentioned organizational forms will experience difficulties if they are faced with extensive and  complex tasks, which depend on cooperation across functions and divisions. These may be development  tasks or demanding non-recurring operations.  
In order to handle such a task, many organizations have experimented with different structural solutions,  which include setting up groups or project groups across the established structure (basic organization).  The language use in these solutions is a bit hesitant. There are three types of organizations; ad hoc  organizations, project organizations or matrix organizations. It is not a matter of making repairs on an  organization but of developing a double-acting organization in which large parts of the organization are  prepared to live with crossing lines.  
2.4.5 Matrix organization 
The matrix principle or matrix organization may be referred to as a theoretical model which can be  realized in different ways. The principles of the matrix organization are shown in the figure below with  the functions; logistics, production and sale and the three products 1, 2 and 3. Note that only functions  that directly influence logistics, production and sale are included in the figure, while other functions  such as accounting are not included.

Figure 2.9: Examples of matrix organization 
Example of matrix organization 
Many industrial companies decide to improve their competitiveness through intensive focus on the  business processes logistics, quality and costs. Companies, which want to improve their performance,  often establish a taskforce, which typically consists of staff analysts. In doing so, a conflict of interest may  arise between top management’s auxiliary arm and the rest of the organization. The consequence is that  change projects lack support and ownership and therefore must be forced through. Several companies  acknowledge that the individual entities cannot go any further in these areas without sub optimizing,  and this may be recommended in preference to working according to matrix organization. 
Demands on organizing 
The company can continue working by establishing an LQC group (logistics, quality and costs), whose  job is to initiate analyses, start projects and implement these primarily within the areas; logistics, quality  and costs. Each main area points out middle managers for the groups who have competences in logistics,  quality and costs. This matrix principle structure secures the group in-depth knowledge of all parts of the  organization. In this way, the matrix organization becomes the pioneer in an organizational development  which aims at better competitiveness.  
Each member of the group should in principle be able to spend an agreed percentage of his working time  on LQC work. The LQC group should share responsibility for choosing and initiating projects and for  establishing working groups for the individual subprojects. In this organizational form, a project should  not be initiated without having a sponsor, i.e. (at least) one manager who has announced that he will carry  the project through the company’s management team. In doing so, it is possible to ensure interaction  with the budget holders and make sure that projects and expenses do not suddenly get out of control.

Organizational theory Four challenges 
Focus on task performance and structure 
To begin with, the concept of a matrix organization sounds good and right, but it is not easy to make a  matrix organization work. The greatest challenges in this type of matrix organization are assessed to be: 
• Shared starting point 
• Shared image of the task 
• Progress 
• Communication and involvement 
In order to ensure a shared starting point and shared understanding and responsibility, it is recommended  to hold a number of meetings for the entire team. However, middle managers typically have a number of  operational tasks which require their presence, and that may make it difficult to gather the entire team.  
Creating a shared image of the idea of the task is another challenge. Different academic backgrounds  and subcultures make it necessary to devote great efforts to teambuilding.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
A third challenge is to make progress in the process. The group must become good at brainstorming  and at locating significant problem areas. Also, the group must learn to transform this into concrete  projects and ensure that someone heads the project. A possible pitfall is that the LQC group turns into  a discussion club, which does not show results. We recommend having focus on project management  and personal responsibility.  
A fourth challenge is to prepare project descriptions which can be communicated to all parts of the  organization, i.e. even the man on the shop floor. This is necessary as one of the LQC group’s purposes  is to create involvement within the organization and to maintain this involvement.  
Process experience 
An important process experience is that matrix identity is also linked to physical identity. Good meeting  rooms facilitate permanent affiliation to the matrix. There should be places where the matrix organization  can store papers etc. so that each participant feels linked to a shared culture. It is recommended to create  a reasonable relationship between messages from the management about the importance of the matrix  organization, and the facilities made available.  
The matrix organization may clash with the company’s position structure and reward system, hence  with the participants’ prioritization of their own working time. Therefore, all members of the matrix  organization must have the opportunity to make the agreed part of their working time available to the  project. A possible pitfall is that members of the group may tend to give first priority to tasks in their  own department as members are only educated and rewarded according to their performance in the  individual departments. 
Results 
The LQC matrix can create the necessary subprojects, e.g. within logistics, quality and costs, and  contribute to the company’s competitiveness. The LQC matrix structure may also be a motive force to  obtaining better business results and organizational development – implemented as part of the operation.

2.4.7 Differences between hierarchical and flat structure 
In his book “Tear down the Pyramids”12, Jan Carlsson focuses on advantages of flat organizations  and direct communication throughout the organization. In doing so, attention is also focused on the  employees under the individual manager; often referred to as “span of control” or a manager’s control  area. Several employees under one manager may contribute to a flatter structure and thereby fewer  middle managers. This is illustrated by the figure below:

2.4.8 Mechanical and organic organizations 
Mechanical systems are simple, dynamic systems with fixed movements like clockwork. Organizations  cannot be considered machines because they are social systems in constant movement. In contrast,  organizations must be considered a mechanism consisting of actions and interdependent parts.  Organizations are no longer held together by formal structures and specific objectives, but rather by  informal structures. Thus, the focus of attention is the actual behavioral structure and relations between  the individual members of the organization.

In this connection, Burns & Stalker discuss mechanical and organic organizational forms characterized  by the following features: 
Criterion 
	Mechanical 
	Organic
	Specialization 
	1. The organization’s problems and tasks  are broken down in specialized job  functions
	1. Importance is attached to expertise  and experience as contributions to the  solving of the organization’s common  tasks
	General orientation 
	2. Individual tasks are structured and  performed on own technical terms  without special regard to the entire  organization.
	2. Individual tasks are considered in a  realistic perspective and linked to the  total situation of the organization
	Coordination 
	3. Coordination of tasks takes place on  each hierarchical level through the  immediate superior
	3. The tasks of the individual are adjusted  an redefined continuously through  interaction with others
	Rights and obligations 
	4. Accurate definitions of rights, obligations  and technical methods linked with each  work role
	4. Responsibility is not a question of a  limited area of rights, obligations, duties  and methods
	Responsibility 
	5. Responsibility means rights, obligations  and technical methods linked to a  
functional position

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Joan Woodward was particularly concerned with the question of how an organization’s production  technology can influence the organizational form. Technology is perceived as part of the organization’s  external environment or context as something the organization is forced to adapt to. This assumption is  problematic. In connection with studies made by a number of industrial companies in different sectors,  Woodward developed a variable called technological complexity. It may be divided into three fields:  
1. Unit production (one or few products according to special order, e.g. advanced instruments) 2. Mass production (e.g. automotive industry) 
3. Continuous process production (e.g. chemical industry, oil refineries) 
Woodward showed that during unit production, the organizational form was characterized by small  working groups with independent responsibility for performing the work. The foremen had high technical  skills and worked closely with the workers. The organization was centered on the skills that were present  in the production departments, and the administrative structure was relatively small compared to the  two other types of technology. Woodward characterizes this organizational form as organic in the same  sense as Burns & Stalker. 
Woodward discovered the strongest contrast to this organizational form in mass production, which  required a strongly formalized organizational form. Work was carried out by unskilled workers. It was  routine and often checked down to the very last detail by a comprehensive administrative superstructure.  Woodward describes the organizational form as bureaucratic: Emphasis on job and position descriptions,  much written communication, clear chains of command, strong separation of line and staff and  great importance attached to planning. She found three important conflict generating factors in this  organizational form: 
1. Stress loads in the physical production between the technical system and the workers’ social  system, 
2. Stress loads between lower and higher levels in the management hierarchy in which the  lower levels were oriented towards immediate production problems while the higher levels  were occupied with long-term problems, 
3. Stress loads between line and staff; between decision-making authority and expertise. 
In a comment on Woodward’s studies, Mintzberg (1979) asserts that management in mass producing  industry becomes obsessed with control as it assumes that the unskilled workers must be supervised and  pressured in order to carry out their work. This control mania reproduces itself from the top throughout  the entire organization, causing unfortunate consequences for all employees.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Woodward found that conditions were different in the process industry where production was automated,  and where relatively few workers were involved. Here, rules and standards were built into the technical  productive apparatus itself. This caused large parts of the most burdening work to disappear, and thus,  so do the causes of many frictions and conflicts. This organizational form becomes less bureaucratic  and more flexible and organic.  
Woodward’s studies have become a more recent classic in organizational theory, and it has inspired a  number of studies of the relationship between technical systems organizational forms. However, it has  also been sharply criticized on several points; it has been claimed that the technological complexity  scale is too coarse, and that it conceals many significant variations in production conditions. A central  controversial point has been the question of possibilities of improvements of working environments in  the mass producing industry. Woodward has a rather pessimistic view of the possibilities of real reforms.  Other scholars have claimed that it is not necessary to put up with the very unfortunate consequences  of mass production (isolation, alienation, attrition, turnover and conflicts), and that there are several  possibilities of improvements: Line production can be changed, and management conditions and power  structure can be democratized. In the Nordic countries, a number of experiments have been performed  in these areas.

2.5 Theory of Administrative Behavior – H. Simon 
Herbert Simon has attempted to clarify the above mentioned characteristics of the rational perspective –  goal specificity and formalization – and explain their connection to rational behavior (1976). He moves  in an individual-psychological level in that he criticizes the individual understanding which lies in e.g.  Taylor’s studies. It is a matter of studies of organizations from the macro level. This conforms to the  historical development in the use of analysis levels where the social-psychological level was the one used  most frequently in early organizational research. Simon’s criticism of Taylor’s studies means a clash with  the ‘Economic Man’, who Simon makes more human by stating that even though the individual seeks  his own interests, he is not always aware of his basic interests.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Simon emphasizes that it is easy to criticize the rational model for its lack of realism. The problem is  not to find points to object to in the model, but to proceed in the understanding of what happens in  organizations when decisions are made. Simon points out that organizational theory will crumble if  certain ideas of rationality are not maintained. Obviously, the classical model breaks down, both when  we want to research decision behavior, and when we want to make decisions in practice. The problem is  serious: How is it possible to reconstruct ideas of rationality and to develop empirical theory on rational  behavior? 
The behavioral patterns that is characteristic for Simon is the behavioral model which he designs and  terms “The Administrative Man” in contrast to “The Economic Man”.  
The main characteristics can be summarized from the figure below with the stages of the decision model: 
1. When we study a person’s choices of actions, we must always use the person’s reference  frame as a starting point. Rationality should be perceived as linked to a specific reference  frame. The person who is to make a decision will always have a simplified model of  the situation which exists. The model is called the situational definition or situational  understanding, cf. problem recognition and problem definition in figure 2.14. 
2. The elements of situational understanding are not taken for granted in the analysis; they will  be the result of a number of psychological and sociological processes. We must also consider  the activities of the decision maker and others in the situation. Thus, the decision maker  will often be active in relation to his external environment, and he will search for a limited  number of alternative actions, and/or a little more knowledge about the consequences of  different alternatives.  
3. Individuals’ and organizations’ decision processes are oriented towards discovering and  choosing between what may be called satisfactory alternatives. Only in clear exceptional  cases, the decision will be oriented towards optimization. Discovering and choosing a  satisfactory alternative is called ‘to satisfy’. What is interesting in this connection is to  examine how people and organizations set certain standards, and how they raise and lower  their standards. A standard reflects a certain aspiration level (e.g. when it comes to market  shares, profit, growth etc.) 
4. Since the administrative person is satisfied with limited knowledge of the situations that he  must consider; he is also capable of making decisions by means of relatively simple rules of  thumb, which do not make impossible demands on overview and knowledge.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
The only way to simplify the conditions for the individual members is to allow their work to steer towards  some delimited objectives. Simon believes that objectives only affect the individual member if they are  significant in his daily conduct. In this way, it becomes the organization’s role to delimit the objectives  that are significant to the individual member. The objectives support the decision, which is based on  two interacting premises: 
• Value premises – assumptions about which solution is preferable 
• Factual premises – deal with the observable world, and how it works.  
Members at the top of the hierarchy typically make use of the value-related component when making  decisions, whereas members situated lower in the hierarchy tend to base their decisions on the factual  component. Based on these characteristics, what March and Simon call ‘objective-mean-chains’ occur, in  which overall objectives, via consideration with focus on ways and solutions, are divided into a number  of sub objectives: 
Set overall objectives (often based on value premises) 
“We must be effective!” 
Overall objectives are analyzed, and means for objective achievement 
are provided 
“How can we be effective – e.g. by making sure that machines do not  
break down” 
These means become objectives and thereby sub objectives which are  
analyzed again… 
“To avoid machines breaking down, all employees who use the machine  
must be trained in operating it correctly” 
-------- 
The chain stops when all members have an objective, which is  
part of their behavior and can thereby simplify decisions for  
everybody. 
Figure 2.16: Objective-mean-chains 
This process creates an objectives hierarchy with fewer objectives to support the overall objective. The  created sub objectives reduce the need for information, and a stable framework is created for the decision  of the individual employee. Thus, it is a matter of administrative regulation of behavior via reduction  of the individual’s decision opportunity in choice situations via setting of objectives on several levels.  As mentioned, this is called limited rationality and again includes the two key elements in the rational  system – the existence of specific objectives and a formalized structure.

2.6 Team organization 
In future companies and organizations, customer service, competence development, job satisfaction  and financial results are closely connected – closer than ever. Companies will experience even greater  challenges in terms of creating learning among employees and promoting a feeling of ownership in  relation to the work. Team organization is a structure and working method that complies with these  needs and challenges. In 2001, West13 discovered that team organization is one of the most widespread  organizational structures and working methods. In American companies with more than 100 employees,  approximately 80% use team organization.  
Thus, many companies need to move away from a traditional, hierarchical organization and in stead  move towards becoming a team based organization. First, we will define a team: 
A team is a small number of people with complementary abilities who mutually have committed  themselves to a common work objective with a work approach that they will hold each other responsible  for14 
This perception of teams may be applied in many contexts, e.g. bicycle teams in Tour de France, jet fighters  flying together, and a herd of geese also flying in V-formation15. A common feature of these and companies  is the desire for a structure and working method that are effective in terms of better results, increased  job responsibility and satisfaction, increased customer satisfaction and improved communication.  
Like bicycle teams in Tour de France, companies and organizations face questions such as: 
• What is the manager’s role in relation to the team? 
• Which degree of management can the managers exercise? 
• Which tools can the managers use to establish and further develop effective teams?16 
We will now focus on team organization and the role of the team manager in order to propose how  a company may build a team based structure, and how a manager can work in relation to his team.  Introductorily, we will briefly outline different typical team based organizational forms in order to indicate  how a team structure may look17, and how management may be carried out in relation to a team. We  distinguish between management of teams and co-management in teams – practical tools which a team  manager can implement in different positions.  
We will conclude by presenting a larger case, which in details describes a manager’s considerations and  disposals in connection with the establishment and development of a team.

2.6.1 Typical team based organizations 
Focus on task performance and structure 
In this section, we will outline three organizational charts which illustrate different levels in team based  organizations. This will show differences between expert teams and cross-functional teams and clarify  the structures surrounding a team.  
Teams may be either specialist or cross-functional. An expert team is a team of e.g.: 
• Sales consultants with a common cost objective. The members have complementary  competences 
• A team of home helpers who perform the same tasks in relation to caring and help for the elderly 
A cross-functional team is e.g. the operating team at a hospital, consisting of the surgeon, assisting  doctors, nurses, anesthetist etc. The cross-functional team tends to contain the greatest potential for  innovation and development18. However, at the same time, there is a large potential for conflicts in the  cross-functional team, presumably because different academic backgrounds increase the dissimilarities  in approaches to a given problem.  
Structurally, a team typically consists of a team manager, who is not part of day-to-day operations and  whose function is to compose and possibly change the team, assign tasks, help the team periodically,  evaluate it and give feedback. The team manager typically carries the responsibility for 3–4 teams.

Focus on task performance and structure 
Furthermore, there will usually be a team coordinator who is part of the team and participates equally  with the other members, while being in charge of the practical coordination of activities and information,  notices for meetings etc. There are various ways of choosing the team coordinator; he may be chosen  by the team manager, be elected internally in the team, or team members may take the job in turns.  In some cases, the team manager and team coordinator is one person, who is part of the team. It may  be difficult to make this structure successful as an active manager internally in the team will easily end  up working against the very idea of team organizing: Giving the team authority by virtue of delegated  responsibility and decision-making competence. Therefore, such a structure requires that the manager is  capable of balancing delegation and establishment of fixed limits and direction of work; a balancing act  that is of course not impossible. This structure is typically found in teams where the level of competence  is so low in relation to cooperation, decision-making process etc. that it is necessary to have a strong,  instructive manager within the team.  
The following models, which show typical team based organizations, are based on the typical structure,  which includes a superior, external team manager and a participating, internal team coordinator. In  order to show the complexity that may exist in different levels of team organization, all the models will  be based on a hospital, beginning with classical team organization and then approaching the structure  from different angles.

Here, each team may consist of 12 nurses who share the tasks and report to the head nurse as their  immediate superior. In the cancer unit, we find an organization that to some extent is based on expert  teams, e.g. groups of specialist doctors (lung cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer etc.), ambulatory nurses  and those responsible for chemotherapy. In expert team organization, a cross-functional team containing  representatives from the different occupational groups is often established to deal with tasks that exceed  the limits of the individual team’s range of competence. In our example, this could be particularly  complicated patient cases involving several wards.

Viewed from a different angle, a hospital ward in many cases works in cross-functional teams, e.g. when  operating and making diagnoses. In a cross-functional team organization, it is often necessary to establish  a cross-functional management team; the management teams’ decisions will appear more legitimate to  the individual occupational group when the group is represented within the team. An example which  illustrates this very clearly is a ward at a hospital where the head nurse changed the staffing in the  management team consisting of a managing consultant doctor and a head nurse, and in stead left it to  the head nurse to manage the ward. The result was that several doctors resigned.

The models provide an overview of a possible structure of a team based organization and clarifies that  there are different roles in relation to the team, depending on the context. When the team manager is part  of a management team, the individual team can in principle take advantage of the entire management  team rather than only reporting to their immediate superior. This is clearly an advantage because it  allows flexibility, e.g. in decision-making when the immediate superior is unavailable. Furthermore, when  several managers are familiar with the work areas and problems of the team, the quality of decisions  made will be raised. However, there is also a potential damaging factor in this constellation in that the  managers may cross each others’ ranges of competence, and that will put the team in an ambiguous  situation. Therefore, it is decisive to clarify the mutual dispersion of competences between managers in  relation to the team.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
Another significant consideration in connection with these two organizational forms is that both the team  and the manager must change practice. If the manager continues to manage in ‘the old-fashioned way’,  this will, in a systemic understanding, maintain the team in its original ‘group practice’. Therefore, the  building of new understanding and practice in team management are decisive. The following questions  will often be helpful for the manager: 
1. What are my rights and obligations as manager in relation to the team? What must I do?  What can I do? What can I not do? What remains unclear and needs to be examined  further? 
2. What are the team’s rights and obligations in relation to our customers/users? In relation to  me as manager and in relation to other teams in the organization? What must the team do?  What can it do? What can it not do? What remains unclear? 
2.7 Pitfalls in focus on task performance and structure 
‘Organizational focus on task performance and structure’ aims at a motive force of formalization and  intensity of purpose to reach rational utilization of the organization’s resources. The starting point is that  the employees’ scope is limited by positions, rules and procedures; hence the name rationality.

Organizational theory 
Focus on task performance and structure 
The pitfalls of organizational focus on task performance and structure are especially linked to lacking  focus on informal structures and influence of the external environment: 
• Organizations without people; it is assumed that employees act rationally on the basis of  established structural conditions and rules and procedures. The rationality is assumed to  arise from the structure and its systems, while the employees are dehumanized.  
• Power and control; focus on task performance and structure causes it to be easier for  managers to gain power and control over others beyond normative structures and  principles.  
• Informal context is overlooked; social, cultural and technical aspects are not included as an  explanation of the organization’s structure and function.  
• External factors are overlooked; focus on internal conditions without including the influence  of external factors.

3 Focus on motivation 
Focus on motivation 
Motivational studies are a search for understanding of human nature. In recognition that the human  element plays a significant role in organizations, this chapter will focus on structuring a theoretical  reference frame for motivation. The purpose of the chapter is to understand past tense human behavior  and to predict, change and influence future behavior in organizations.  
Many researchers have contributed to an increased understanding of motivation and human behavior in  organizations. In their research, David C. McClelland and John W. Atkinson19 pointed to the connection  between an employee’s motivation and his performance. The figure below shows that the degree of  motivation is at its highest when the probability of success is around 50%, i.e. there is a fifty-fifty percent  chance of success and failure. The bell-shaped line also indicates that the strength of the motivation  declines when the probability of success exceeds 50%. This is also the case when the probability of  success is otherwise increasing. The researchers’ conclusion is that employees are not motivated when  the objective is difficult or almost unrealistic to reach, or when it is relatively easy to reach.

This connection provides an explanation of motivation. Furthermore, human behavior and motivation  are individual for each person and influenced by other conditions within the organization20. Thus,  motivation may be very different from organization to organization. This is illustrated by the two  examples of companies below. The surveys of the two companies’ motivational factors were performed  in 2005, so they are comparable in terms of time. The first example is an industrial company where 25  managers and key employees participated in the survey to determine the most important motivational  factors to a person. Each employee was asked to prioritize three motivational factors, i.e. the conditions  which motivated the person the most.

Focus on motivation 
It appears from the figure that the company’s key employees are motivated by: 
1. Challenging tasks 
2. Open and honest communication with immediate manager 
3. Credit for well performed work 
4. Result-oriented culture 
5. Influence 
The most significant motivational factors for these people are challenges in terms of working across the  country’s culture and language, and professionally challenging tasks. Also, they expect the management  style to be supporting and developing. The monetary award system of this company is based on five  shared objectives for the 25 employees.  
The second example is a commercial company where 28 manager and employees prioritized their most  significant motivational factors. The figure below shows the result of the survey.

The result is that the most important motivational factors are: 
1. Pay/bonus 
2. Challenging tasks 
3. Good working environment  
4. Credit for well performed work 
5. Open and honest communication with immediate manager 
Focus on motivation 
Pay/bonus is the most important motivational factor in this commercial company where the culture  is sales-oriented and underpinned by a result-oriented monetary award for the individual employee.  At the same time, the employees of this company expect professionally challenging tasks and a good  working environment.  
The above indicates that motivation may be explained through many different conditions. We need  a definition of concepts and a reference frame in which we can view these explanations in a context.  There are various definitions of the concept of motivation. The following definitions are among the most  recognized21:  
Motivation is “the energy that a person expresses in connection with the work”22

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
“Motivation means an inner wish to make an effort”23 
It may be appropriate to connect motivation with three common psychological processes so that there  are three elements in the process of motivation: 
• Initiation: Motivated behavior is typically initiated by a need or desire to achieve a specific  thing or condition 
• Direction: Personal objectives are typically directive for motivational behavior • Intensity: Motivated behavior is typically aimed at the most favorable objectives rather than  less favorable objectives 
The result of this motivational process is the specific motivated behavior, which is typically characterized  by four factors: 
• Focus: Motivation creates focus on specific tasks, persons, subjects etc. 
• Effort: Motivation creates energy and effort 
• Persistence: The greater the motivation, the greater the perseverance 
• Task plan: Motivation typically causes us to engage in making plans for ways to be  successful when solving a given task. 
The result of motivational behavior is performance. The connection between the three concepts is: 
Motivation is a psychological condition, which affects a person’s behavior. Performance relates to an  external standard, which is typically formulated by others than the person himself.  
The motivational process (initiation, direction, intensity) is influenced by a number of factors, some of  which are mentioned in the figure below. Here, the factors are divided into two main groups: Individual  conditions and job situation.

Figure 3.4: The motivational model’s process, behavior and performance 
As the figure indicates, the two sets of factors – individual conditions and job situation – can influence  the motivational process (being motivated), and they may have direct independent influence on the actual  behavior. For example, the organization’s culture and values may create motivation, but the culture may  also be a barrier to the development of motivation. Also, the personal desire to take on a given task may  be inhibited by a lack of faith in own abilities.  
Motivation is always reflected concurrently with the ability to perform the concrete tasks. Thus, high  motivation is no guarantee for good performance.  
3.1 Theoretical approaches to motivation 
There are several theories on motivation, and no recognized theory can integrate these theories. The  purpose of the model below is to collect some of the most important theories on motivation in one key  model, which structures and systematizes the many aspects of motivation.

The model divides the theories into two main categories: Theories related to so-called inner motivation  and theories related to outer motivation, thus motivation coming from the inside and outside, respectively.  The theories are also connected, e.g. we will touch on the connection between expectation and fairness  in the section which discusses fairness.  
3.2 Inner motivation  
This section concerns the motivation that comes from the inside and deals with both conscious and  unconscious needs. 
Theories on inner motivation may be divided into several groups: 
Rational factors: 
• Expectancy Theory 
• Self-efficacy 
• Management by Objectives

Irrational factors: 
• Needs theories 
• Maslow’s needs theory 
• C. Alderfer’s needs theory 
• D. McClelland’s theory 
• Qualifications/personality 
They will be discussed in the above order.  
3.3 Motivational theory based on rational factors 
Among motivational theories, which are based on rational factors, the most recognized theories are:  
• Expectancy Theory 
• Self-efficacy 
• Objectives 
3.3.1 Expectancy Theory 
The Expectancy Theory24 attempts to explain and predict motivated behavior. It tries to answer the  following question: What determines a person’s readiness for motivated behavior? 
The Expectancy Theory draws on thoughts from rational science, including the idea that human behavior  is controlled by a desire for maximum use of a given behavior. Thus, a formula can be used to express  the theory:  
• Motivation = E × I × V (Motivation = Expectancy (E) times Instrumentality (I) times  Valence (V). Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence) 
• E = Expectancy, i.e. the relevant employee’s expectations that his performance leads to the  desired result, i.e. that the performance will be successful. 
• I = Instrumentality, i.e. the personal assessment of the probability of different rewards as  a consequence of successful task performance. Some rewards will in all probability occur  while others have significantly smaller or very poor probability.  
• V = Value, i.e. the value attached to these rewards by the employee concerned. Examples of  rewards are promotion, higher pay, time off, credit etc. The factor V is the personal value of  possible rewards and is often called Valence.

47 
Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
The above is a mathematic formula, and that means that if just one of the factors has very low value (e.g.  if the expectations of success are very low, or the personal value of the possible rewards is very low, or  the instrumentality of positive rewards is very low), the total motivation will be low as well.  
According to the theory, motivation only exists if there is a certain concurrence between the probability  of success, the expectation that there will be rewards and the value of these rewards to the employee  concerned.  
In short, motivation is controlled by the employee’s faith in a positive connection between efforts, success  and reward value.  
Studies have proven that the Expectancy Theory is a quite reliable theory. However, its biggest problem  is that is depends on man’s ability to make rational choices (between behavior which results in high and  low rewards respectively). However, only a minority of people is able to comprehend the exact connection  between efforts, results and reward values, and therefore, the theory is not able to explain all differences  in organizational behavior. It is generally difficult to predict the degree of success precisely or to know  exactly which rewards are possible, or to make an accurate comparison of the value of different rewards.  
The implications for the manager are: 
• It is important that a reward for good performance has actual value for the employee. This  may be decided by asking the employee what is valuable to him – e.g. during appraisal  reviews.  
• It must be possible to distinguish between success and failure. Clear success criteria should  be established so that the parties agree on the criterion for successful results.  
• It is important that the employee is able to assess his own competences realistically.  Exaggerated self-efficacy creates motivation but hardly success, and exaggerated lack of self efficacy reduces the motivation despite great probability of success.  
• The reward system should be structured in a way that allows better performance to cause  better rewards.  
• Training and coaching are important managerial tasks for the purpose of creating the  necessary self-efficacy. 
• The employees’ perception of the connection between effort and reward is often part of the  so-called psychological contract which the employee makes with the company when hired.  Here, the mutual expectations, which to a high degree will be essential for the employee’s  perception of possible rewards, are reconciled.  
The psychological contract must be discussed continuously for the purpose of creating the necessary  clarity and making necessary adjustments so that the contract conforms to the actual conditions.

Organizational theory 3.3.2 Self-efficacy 
Focus on motivation 
The concept of self-efficacy’s influence on motivation is relatively new within motivational research.  Bandura (1989) defines self-efficacy as: 
The faith in one’s own ability to mobilize motivation, one’s cognitive resources, and one’s own  ability to choose the right actions in relation to the specific expectations. 
A large part of the research in this area has concentrated on the so-called Pygmalion/Golem effect. In  short, the Pygmalion effect refers to the notion that by communicating high expectations, it is possible  to strengthen the self-efficacy and hereby improve performance. In contrast, the Golem effect refers to  the notion that by communicating low expectations, self-efficacy and thereby performance is decreased.  
There has been some discussion about whether self-efficacy is solely or broadly speaking a by-product of  experience from earlier tasks and has no influence as such on motivational considerations about future  tasks. Or in other words: Is self-efficacy solely a product of one’s own considerations regarding the specific  task, or is self-efficacy a product of one’s experiences from previous, similar tasks?

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
Briefly stated, this means that the manager must communicate high expectations from the employee’s  performance and make sure that any unfounded fear of failing is discusses thoroughly. As mentioned  in the section on Expectancy Theory, any negative expectations from own success will be destructive  motivation.  
Employees generally have quite good recognition of their own capability, but in connection with new  tasks, it is especially important to maintain that existing competences constitute a strong foundation  for success.  
Coaching and appraisal interviews typically function as the dialogic room in which these expectations  are expressed.  
3.3.3 Management by Objectives  
The theory of Management by Objectives (MBO) is based on the notion that most human behavior is  based on unconscious choices of objectives and intentions. Action has a direction and a desired result.  
Techniques for setting objectives are the practical use of a number of motivational theories – especially  Expectancy Theory. The notion is that the objectives and the process of setting objectives itself may have  a positive influence on motivation and thereby performance.  
Objectives are effective as a motivational mechanism, and there are several explanations for that:  
• Being obligated to fulfill an objective creates focus on objective-relevant activities and  removes the attention from non-objective-relevant activities.  
• Objectives create energy, and challenging objectives create greater effort than easy objectives  do. 
• Objectives create persistence. High objectives extend the effort, and tight deadlines increase  the working pace.  
• Objectives motivate the employees to use their knowledge and skills to reach the objective. • The main motivating factor may not be the objectives per se, but rather the experience of  their attractiveness, relevance and significance for the personal development and well-being. 
In a sense, it may be argued that positive objectives benefit both the company and the employee in such  a way that both parties’ interests and intentions are taken into account.  
From a company point of view, objectives must be broken down and composed in a way that allows the  employees’ behavior and performance to be held together in a balanced whole.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
From an employee point of view, clear and accepted objectives generate better possibilities of independence  and autonomy in the job, i.e. what in some connections is referred to as self-management.  
These days, many companies are restructuring the internal allocation of tasks and responsibility. The  consequences may be fewer layers of management, matrix or project structures, outsourcing and  networking, and more decentralized management on all levels. This development causes an increased  need for greater agreement about and accept and clarity of objectives. This does not necessarily lead  to implementation of more measuring systems, but the development increases the need for internal  communication and dialog.  
Research indicates that: 
• High and concrete objectives influence performance positively. 
• Feedback is important when objectives are high and concrete 
• Accepted objectives strengthen motivation and performance, which is connected with the  fact that objectives, which are set jointly, are often a little more ambitious than objectives set  by the manager alone.  
As mentioned above, high objectives tend to increase performance. Furthermore, research indicates that  objectives have a poor or even negative impact when it comes to complex or new tasks. 
Therefore, the conclusion appears to be that more stringent and consistent performance management  will have the greatest effect when the methods for reaching the objective are well-known and accepted.  
With a view to forming and directing organizational behavior, objectives are important managerial tools.  Generally, it is assumed that in order to have the full effect, objectives must comply with the following  conditions:  
Objectives must be SMART, i.e. they must be: 
Specific 
Measurable 
Ambitious and Attractive 
Realistic 
Time related 
If there is more than one objective, they must be non-conflicting and possible to prioritize. Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
The employee concerned must have the sufficient knowledge and skills to reach the objective. Furthermore,  the objectives must be perceived as achievable. If they seem unrealistic, unachievable or too difficult, it  creates fear and a very bad learning process. In these cases, it is preferable to aim at learning objectives  rather than performance objectives.  
The employee must be committed to the objective – especially if the objective is difficult. As mentioned  above, the consequences of achieving an objective must be favorable for the employee, and he must  have faith in his own ability to reach the objectives (Expectancy Theory). In this connection, it may be  a good idea to make the objectives public, ensure that the manager expresses his confidence in success  and secure that there is a clear connection to vision and strategies. Sometimes, financial incentives may  also be helpful.  
Feedback as to whether the process is on track is immensely significant. The committed employee will  adjust his efforts or speed if he is running behind schedule.  
High objectives for complex tasks must be used carefully. In some cases, it will be better to start with the  necessary training. Another solution is to aim at sub objectives. A third solution is to aim at learning  objectives as mentioned above.

Situational conditional barriers may prevent the achievement of objectives. It is the management’s job  to ensure that the employees have the necessary resources and to remove any barriers to achievement  of set objectives.  
It is important to formulate and communicate objectives. This may be done in writing in different internal  papers, or orally, e.g. at staff meetings, and – especially – through annual/biannual appraisal interviews.  
Setting objectives is an increasingly important management task, but the management must think  carefully before getting caught up in the pervasive objectives euphoria. Few of the factors which are  measured today can be mapped out, much less interpreted by means of simple measurements.  
People tend to do the things, which are measurable, especially if a reward/punishment is linked to the  achievement of set objectives. This is why objectives contribute to shaping and directing organizational  behavior. There is much truth in the saying; what you get is what you measure, but it makes even greater  demands on the validity and relevance of the measurement. One solution is to set both quantitative  and qualitative objectives, and to set objectives for team behavior, which can be included in annual or  biannual behavioral measurements in the team.  
Objectives constrain and divide reality into what is measurable and what is not. There is good reason to  consider the use of different measuring techniques carefully.  
3.4 Motivational theory based on needs 
Most needs theorists agree that needs are unobservable, internal forces, which create tension when  objectives are not reached. People will try to reduce or remove this tension through action. Needs are  considered motivating because the tension triggers attention, action and persistence.  
3.4.1 Maslow’s needs model 
A. Maslow’s needs model25 is probably the most well-known and popular model on needs.  Maslow believed that human needs could be classified in a hierarchy of five basic needs:  
• Self-actualization needs: Need to realize one’s deepest creative and productive potential. • Esteem needs: Need for self-esteem, self-respect and appreciation from others. • Social needs: Need to socialize with other people, need for relationships based on emotions,  need for friendships. 
• Safety needs: Need for physical and psychological stability and safety. 
• Physiological needs: Primary needs; water, food and a home.

Figure 3.6: Maslow’s pyramid of needs 
The idea of the hierarchy is to show that needs on a given level must be satisfied before the needs on  the next level become interesting. Or expressed in another way, the ‘lowest’ unsatisfied need will be the  most dominant for human behavior.  
Furthermore, only unsatisfied needs can function as motivation. 
At a first glance, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs seems appealing, but it is important to note that the model  is only to a lesser degree supported by empirical research. However, there seems to be consensus that  needs are arranged hierarchically.  
Later needs models (cf. Alderfer) have modified Maslow’s model by only operating with three basic  levels. It has not been possible to document the progression in the hierarchy suggested by Maslow. On  the contrary, doubts have been raised as to whether satisfied needs stop functioning as motivation, and  several factors indicate that social needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs can function as  concurrent motivational factors.  
Furthermore, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs has been criticized from a cross-cultural perspective (see e.g.  Hofstede). In some cultures, safety needs and social needs will exert significantly greater influence on  motivation than self-actualization needs. There is in fact good reason to assume that the needs hierarchy  is structured differently in different cultures.  
However, it is important to keep in mind that Maslow imagined his needs theory as a humanist perspective  on human motivation in general – not as a model which could form a basis for empirical testing.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
The five basic needs per se set guidelines for the organization of both companies and jobs:  
• Self-actualization needs: Autonomy, independence, responsibility, challenges, personal  development. 
• Esteem needs: Recognition, feedback, position, promotion. 
• Social needs: Social contact, teambuilding, positive feedback, network. 
• Safety needs: Psychological working environment, senior employees’ policy, insurance  scheme, pension scheme, employment contract, personnel policy. 
• Physiological needs: Health insurance, pay, physical working environment etc. 
Although the model is universal, it is important to keep in mind that employees’ needs may be very  different at different points of time, and that employees try to satisfy their needs either at work or in  their spare time.  
Needs are significant but differ in meaning. This points towards situation-specific use of Maslow’s needs  theory. The manager must base the motivating behavior on the employees’ needs and not on his own  needs or his own idea of what their needs are.  
Research has shown that Maslow’s model only has little prediction force, meaning that it can only predict  the employees’ behavior to a minor extent.  
The model’s greatest significance lies in the recognition and identification of individual needs.

3.4.2 Alderfer’s needs theory 
C. Alderfer’s needs theory26 is among other things an attempt to modify A. Maslow’s needs model in the  sense that the number of basic levels is reduced from five to three. These are: 
• Growth: Need for creative and productive development (corresponds with Maslow’s self actualization need) 
• Relatedness: Need for meaningful interaction and relationships (corresponds with Maslow’s  social needs) 
• Existence: Basic survival needs (corresponds with Maslow’s psychological needs and safety  needs) 
Hence the name ‘the ERG model’. 
Growth 
Relatedness 
Existence 
Figure 3.7: Alderfer’s ERG theory 
The model contains the same satisfaction progression as Maslow’s model, but there is an additional  element to the theory in that Alderfer believed that unsatisfied needs can make the person regress at a  lower needs level, i.e. place even more emphasis on the satisfaction of needs placed lower in the hierarchy.  A frustration progression.  
The ERG model is supported by empirical studies to a higher degree than Maslow’s model, and  conceptually, it corresponds better with the way we generally express our needs. Therefore, the model  may be better for interpreting how needs influence individual behavior.  
Implications for management:  
Alderfer’s model encourages the following six diagnostic questions, which the manager must ask himself: 
• What are the needs of the individual employee? 
• What needs are satisfied? 
• Based on the Hierarchy of Needs, what is the lowest unsatisfied need? 
• Are there needs on a higher level, which are not satisfied? 
• Has the employee increased his focus on lower needs out of frustration? 
• How can unsatisfied needs be satisfied?

Furthermore, Alderfer believed that the importance of higher needs increases when they are satisfied.  Self-actualization so to speak creates a need for self-actualization.  
3.4.3 McClelland’s motivational theory 
D. McClelland’s theory27 uses the management group as a starting point, and he focuses on three  meaningful needs, which he believe are culturally acquired and therefore possible to change through  training.  
He does not deal with progression and regression between needs (see A. Maslow and C. Alderfer) but  with the needs/motives that have significant influence on productivity and efficiency in working life.  
McClelland’s three needs, which are often called the APA needs, are: 
• Achievement need: Need to achieve high performance and to master difficult and complex  tasks.  
• Power need: Need to take responsibility, take charge, gain influence, and the willingness to  make a difference. McClelland distinguishes between social power needs, i.e. the need to  perform well for others and/or the entire company, and personal power needs, i.e. the need  to create personal gain. 
• Affiliation need: Need for social interaction and need to create and maintain friendships.  
McClelland believes that all people have different composition of the three needs, but that one of the  needs is usually dominating.  
Like Maslow and Alderfer, McClelland has been criticized, but his theory is still among the most tested  motivational theories, and especially the achievement need has formed the basis for a good deal of  motivational research. 
Implications for management: 
People with a high achievement need tend to be very objective-oriented and aim at high, but not unrealistic  objectives. They want to have influence on the solution to their own tasks, and they have a high energy  level and work hard. They demand quick and concrete feedback and appreciate performance management  and performance pay. Furthermore, they have a high approach level, i.e. they tend to be very proactive.  
People with a high social power need should be placed in positions where they are able to practice  legitimate, social control.

Focus on motivation 
People with a high affiliation need seek closeness with others and generally want extensive interpersonal  interaction. People with a low affiliation need do not have problems with working alone for longer  periods of time.  
McClelland found a common behavioral pattern among managers. For first line managers and middle  managers, a combination of medium to high power need and low relations need seems to result in  effective management. The higher the manager is placed in the hierarchy, the greater is the significance  of having the ability to master interpersonal relations. At a high organizational level, the combination of  high (social) power need and high relations need is probably the most optimum for effective management.

McClelland’s theory also depends very much on culture – and cannot as such be extended to Scandinavian  conditions. It should also be remembered that the managerial role at all levels has changed a great deal  since McClelland performed his studies. 
3.5 Outer motivation 
There are a number of recognized theories to help managers create motivated behavior by means of  outer factors in relation to the employees: 
• Job Design 
• Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene and Motivation Theory 
• Hackman & Oldham’s Job Characteristics Model 
• Reinforcement theory 
• Social justice 
• Organizational culture 
These will be discussed in what follows (Organizational culture will be reviewed in chapter 4 together  with the increased need for learning in organizations). Several of the theories are characterized by being  general in their perception of outer motivational factors. This applies to e.g. Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene  and Motivation Theory, which will be criticized when discussed.

3.5.1 Job Design 
The link between Job Design, by which we understand the arrangement, design and contents of the job,  and motivation and job satisfaction has not been given much attention in the research industry in the  last decades despite that: 
• Job Design has proven to play a great role in practical attempts to generate more satisfaction  and greater effectiveness. 
• A large part of many managers’ jobs is to further develop existing Job Designs. • The structure of the job has significant influence on the person who is to perform the job. • Additional knowledge in this field may create insight into motivational relationships. 
Here, we will present a few of the theories which set the trend in the 1970s. Both theories belong in the  category ‘Job Enrichment Approaches’.  
3.5.2 Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene and Motivation theory 
F. Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene and Motivation theory is an empirically founded theory about the  factors that influence job satisfaction and thereby motivation. Herzberg’s empirical studies are based on  conditions in 11 American companies in the 1960s and should be read in that perspective.  
According to Herzberg, job satisfaction is influenced by a number of job factors, which separately give the  individual employee either more or less satisfaction, or more or less dissatisfaction. Through his studies,  Herzberg discovered that employees do not evaluate the significance of the individual factors on one scale  ranging from satisfied to dissatisfied, but rather on two separate scales: One that ranges from satisfied  to dissatisfied, and one ranging from dissatisfied to satisfied. Therefore, job factors can be divided into  two groups: One group of job factors which influences the degree of satisfaction (motivational factors),  and one that influences the degree of dissatisfaction (maintenance factors).

Focus on motivation 
Note that the time perspective is unclear in Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene and Motivation theory. Other  researchers point to the fact that in terms of time, basic pay has short motivational effect. However,  Herzberg’s 2 Factor Hygiene and Motivation theory does not distinguish between basic pay and  performance-related pay. Conversely, many motivational factors have a long motivational effect, and  Herzberg’s theory does not consider this.  
Implications for management:  
According to Herzberg, the maintenance factors in this way contribute to removing dissatisfaction, but  they cannot generate satisfaction (motivation). Only motivational factors can do that. Thus, motivation  cannot be generated by ensuring extra good maintenance factors – including extra good pay and bonus  conditions.  
Both groups of job factors are important, and one group is not more important than the other. The factors  are complementary but cannot replace each other in the long term. Herzberg believed that particularly  good maintenance factors/working conditions generate increased effort in the short term, but merely  move the expectancy level in the long term and thereby do not change the effort.  
Studies show that fundamentally, there is some truth to this two-dimensional division, but the distinction  between maintenance and motivational factors is not as clear as Herzberg assumed. Among several points  of criticism, no studies have been able to ascertain that pay is solely a maintenance factor.  
Therefore, the greatest merit of the theory lies in the confrontation with the one-dimensional thinking,  i.e. that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are contrasts. The conclusion is that the different job factors have  different significance for the motivation of the individual employee.  
The weakness of the theory is that is does not take account of the fact that individuals have their own  personal motivational structure, or that groups of employees have differentiated needs-orientation. In  stead, the theory perceives employees’ motivational factors as a general feature. Therefore, the theory is  not applicable for e.g. the preparation of a recruitment strategy for employees, who are satisfied through  a result-oriented reward system.

What is a good job – according to Herzberg? 
In direct continuation of his motivational theory, Herzberg outlined the standards for a good job. The  standards are included in his job enrichment model and consist of the following elements:  
• Personal communication authority, i.e. possibility of communicating directly with the  person one has a need to communicate with.  
• Personal responsibility. 
• Direct feedback from those who use one’s work. 
• Personal development, including the possibility of constantly learning something new. • Allocation of own resources. 
• Personal planning – on an annual, quarterly, monthly and basis and during meal and coffee  breaks.  
• Direct client relations, i.e. close cooperation with the people who use one’s work. • Personal specialization, i.e. the job allows for the opportunity to specialize in one or several  areas.  
3.5.3 Hackman & Oldham’s Job Characteristic model  
Hackman & Oldham developed Herzberg’s theory further as they believed that it had a number of  weaknesses. They wanted a more detailed understanding of how job characteristics are related to job  satisfaction. They suggested five job characteristics which all have significant influence on the job owner  psychological relation with the job: 
• Variety in competence requirements: i.e. the job allows broad employment of the  employees’ collective skills. 
• Meaningful work: i.e. to what extent the employee feels responsible for a meaningful  entirety of the total job. 
• Covering stakeholders’ needs: i.e. to what extent the employee’s work has a positive  influence on the lifes and welfare of others. 
• Degrees of freedom: i.e. the extent to which the results of the work function as feedback for  the employee (not the manager’s feedback). 
To chart the individual job in relation to these five characteristics, Hackman & Oldham worked out a  so-called Job Diagnostic Survey. This questionnaire has formed the basis of subsequent research.  
As mentioned above, Job Design’s influence on motivation and satisfaction is often charted through an  employee satisfaction survey. However, in the practical implementation of Job Design theories, it is a  problem that the employees adjust their attitudes, behavior and expectations to the social context. This  happens through so-called social information. It means that the employee’s feedback in the employee  satisfaction surveys is not objective but socially based. In other words, the employee’s perception of the  job does not depend on ‘objective’ observations but is based on other’s opinions and perceptions, which  are systemized for the purpose of coordinating and making sense.

The social surroundings provide us with: 
Focus on motivation 
• Information about which dimensions in the job we should focus on in our characteristic of  the job.  
• Information about how we should weight the individual dimensions (is autonomy important  or unimportant etc.) 
• Information about how others weight the same dimensions.  
• Information about positive and negative sides of the individual dimensions Generally, research seems to show that:  
• Perceptions of and attitudes to the job are influenced by social information. • Employees actively compare their job with other people’s jobs. 
• The significance of social information for perceptions and attitudes seems to be smaller than  significance of the job itself. 
• Social information primarily influences attitudes, but objective job characteristics influence  both attitudes and the actual behavior.

3.5.4 Skinner’s Rewards/Reinforcement Theory 
The basis for the Rewards/Reinforcement Theory is B.F. Skinner’s belief that human behavior is controlled  and maintained by conditions in the surroundings (operant conditioning). 
Behavior may be random and influenced by experiments, but there is a tendency that behavior which is  rewarded will be repeated – and that behavior, which is punished, will be avoided. This is called positive  and negative reinforcement.  
Thus, motivating becomes a question of identifying the current needs in order to be able to provide the  proper rewards.  
Apart from the earliest laboratory experiments with animals, the theory has mostly been tested on  relatively simple organizational behavior such as quantitative outputs and absence due to illness. However,  the theory has proven to be sufficient in predicting behavior in modern-day complex working life.  
Requirements for effective reward systems: 
• Rewards must be clearly defined and consistent with other rewards for comparable tasks or  expertise.  
• Employees must be informed about exactly what they will be rewarded for.  • Employees should not receive the same rewards because they do not perform identically.  • Rewards must cover the current needs of the employees 
• Rewards must be distributed fairly. 
• Rewards must at least correspond with rewards of competitors or comparable organizations. • Rewards must be large enough to be personally satisfactory. 
• Rewards must be able to satisfy the employees who deliver top performances. • Rewards must be related to performance.  
• Rewards must concur with the organizational context, i.e. values, management style, strategy  and structure.  
Modern reward systems such as ‘personal pay packages’ are systems that allow the individual employee  to decide how much of the pay will be set aside for pension, car, vacation, health scheme etc. The  motivational aspect is that the employee feel appreciated because he is given the opportunity to influence  the composition of his pay package. In terms of motivation, performance is ascribed too much value  when adjusted to the individual employee and his valence.

3.5.5 Pathfinder Theory  
The Pathfinder Theory is closely connected to the Expectancy Theory, which states that organizational  behavior is the result of a choice between various possible actions with different value for the person  who chooses. The rational person will always choose the action which generates the greatest expected  personal value.  
Among other things, the expectations depend on the extent to which the employee assesses that ‘the  efforts bear fruit’. The Pathfinder Theory is a theory about how and on which conditions the manager  can strengthen motivation by clarifying how the desired objective is reached easiest.  
For the manager, it is about clarifying vague information and removing elements of uncertainty and  organizational barriers.  
The extent and character of help and interference are closely connected with the management’s choice of  management style, and the entire theory is closely connected with the theory on situational management.  
3.5.6 Organizational justice  
In recent years, the theme organizational justice has received a good deal of attention among researchers.  It deals with people’s perception of fair treatment, and a distinction is made between what is referred to  here as distributive justice and procedural justice. 
Distributive justice 
A number of motivational theories are based on the assumption that the starting point of the individual  person’s choice of motivated or non-motivated behavior is the person’s personal situation. This may be  a needs situation or considerations concerning physical or psychological rewards. However, surveys  show that people use both external and internal comparisons to a large extent when deciding what  ‘appropriate’ behavior is.  
It has been documented that the concrete behavior is determined by e.g. an assessment of whether there  is a subjectively experienced connection between input and output. However, comparison between the  person himself and comparable colleagues is another and perhaps more important comparison. 
The fundamental idea of the theory on distributive justice is that people compare the relationship between  input and output for themselves to the same relationship for other comparable persons, i.e. how do I  perform, and what do I receive compared to what others perform and receive?

66 
Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
If a person assesses that the result of this comparison is not fair, the person will be motivated to create  justice by changing the sizes of input and output either for himself, or for the persons who he has  compared himself with. This may happen by e.g. reducing his input, or demanding higher pay or better  conditions. It may furthermore happen by simply finding other people to compare with. Finally, lack of  justice may result in the person quitting his job. 
Thus, the theory presumes that the individual person is aware of and familiar with relevant input-output  sizes for the colleagues he wants to compare himself to – e.g. knowledge about other’s pay.  
Surveys have primarily focused on comparing objective factors such as pay, but it is assumed that the  actual comparison is based on both objectively measurable factors and more subjective assessments.  
It must be added that the sensitivity to imbalances in distribution varies a great deal among employees.  
Procedural justice 
One thing is whether the benefits are fairly distributed; another is whether the distribution process per  se is perceived as fair – i.e. whether a person has had the expected influence on the process, whether  his opinions have been heard, whether the information has been sufficient etc.

Research indicates that the two types of justice can replace each other to a certain degree, i.e. that if  the distribution seems fair, the process itself does not play as great a role, and conversely, if the process  seems fair, then unsatisfactory distribution is acceptable to a certain extent.  
When comparing the justice theories to the Expectancy Theory, there are three conditions which may  generate motivation.  
• Employees who experience fair reward systems 
• Clarity between result and effort 
• Correlation between result and reward 
Implications for management 
There seems to be no doubt that a comparison of what colleagues receive and perform plays a role in  the perception of what is fair (and unfair).  
It has been argued, although not proven, that persons, who feel that they are in reality being rewarded too much  in relation to their effort, may be inclined to increase the effort to make it correspond better with the reward. 
Some companies choose to hinder the possibility of comparison by e.g. keeping rewards secret. Other  companies choose the opposite strategy – e.g. large parts of the public sector – so that it is relatively easy  to compare. Arguments can be leveled both for and against both strategies.  
As part of the distribution processes, the employees should be treated with the necessary dignity and  respect and in a way that makes them feel that they receive the necessary information about the processes  that affect them. 
3.6 Motivation and money  
We will now return to the question which both theorists and practitioners raise frequently: Can money  function as motivation? As mentioned earlier, money is a complicated motivational factor, which is  interconnected with other motivating factors and is therefore difficult to determine. Many publications  on organizational theory refer to Lindahl’s classical study of “What Do Workers Want From Their  Jobs28” – see the figure below. In this study, both employees and their immediate superior were asked  to prioritize the employees’ top ten working conditions. The figure shows the considerable differences  between the answers; the employees give priority to credit for performed work while the managers think  that the employees give highest priority to money.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
Buschardt, Toso og Schnake29 pointed out that money is one of the strongest motivational factors, and  that its use must be closely linked to the values of the individual employee. Money and values can be  linked together by using the expectancy theories as mentioned above. The writers suggest three points  for consideration: 
1. Net priority to money. The individual employee must give high ‘net’ priority to money so  that the positive effects of more money outweigh the disadvantages of long and demanding  working weeks.  
2. Direct linkage between money and performance. The individual employee must experience  a clear connection between performance and money; increased performance generates a  reward and the other way around.  
3. Direct linkage between effort and performance. The individual employee must experience a  clear connection between effort and result.  
More recent studies indicate that money as a motivational factor is prioritized differently depending  on the job category. The figure below shows an outline of five surveys of five different job categories’  prioritization of wishes for the job, including prioritization of money in relation to other factors.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
Note that the only motivational factor that is included in all five job categories is money, and it is on the  top 3 list of all employees. Among truck drivers and nurses, money is the most important motivational  factor of all. Among social and healthcare assistants and doctors, independent work is the most important  motivational factor. Finally, the most important motivational factor among plant managers is corporate  philosophy.  
3.7 Motivation and absence due to illness 
Generally, companies spend a lot of money on absence due to illness, e.g. Danish companies spend more  than DKK 20 billion on employees’ illness every year. Therefore, there is a need for more knowledge  about the correlations between management, motivation and absence due to illness. 
Recent research indicates that managers’ motivating skills influence the amount of absence due to illness  in the organization. The German researcher, Bertolt Stein, has done research on illness absence on the  German labor market and concludes that the general perception of the problem should be reversed.  Companies often use control and punishment to reduce illness absence. Far most companies treat  symptoms when reacting to much illness absence, e.g. by inviting the employees for interviews and  asking for a medical statement. In doing so, many employees feel that suspicion is thrown at them and  that they have no influence.  
Managers’ lacking ability to motivate the employees is the best explanation for much absence due to  illness. Therefore, managers need new tools to be able to change the absence. Bertolt Stein concluded  that these factors are decisive when managers want to change the motivation of employees.  
1. Avoid throwing suspicion on employees. If the employee comes to work after one day of  illness, avoid throwing suspicion on the person by using negative communication.  2. Influence on working days. Give employees influence on their working days so that it is  meaningful for them to be at work.  
3. Manageable tasks. Make sure that the employees can manage the tasks they are given so that  they do not feel any unnecessary pressure.  
4. Transparency. Make sure that the organization is transparent so that the individual employee  can see which role he plays, and why his work is important. 
These factors again depend on the context. In a German steel processing company, the management  reduced the illness absence from 12 per cent to 4.5 per cent, e.g. by offering the employees the possibility  of calling in sick without having to hand in a medical statement. In this way, the employees could stay  home for just one day in stead than 3–4 days, which medical statements often show.

3.8 Motivation and age 
In Northern Europe, the average age in the workforce is increasing, and the number of older people  is increasing while the number of younger people is declining. To this should be added the long list  of political measures to raise the age at retirement. This situation causes a number of problems, one  of them being the question of what consequences this development has on companies’ efficiency. One  consequence will probably be more focus on, and a changed attitude to, employment, retention and  motivation of older employees.  
Consequences of adult development  
It is a general assumption that adult development means gradually reduced abilities, but this assumption  is too simple. Adult development is typically connected with the following four processes:  
• Loss of intelligence. Certain intelligence theories indicate a gradual loss of cognitive abilities  (Gf factor), including especially memory capacity, the ability to think abstractly, attention  and ability to communicate new knowledge. It may be argued that although this is the case,  it is hardly a problem as only a minority of employees uses their full intelligence capacity in a  normal working situation. However, it must be assumed that as age progresses, more resources  (e.g. working hours) are required for the same amount of cognitive resources. 
• Growth of intelligence. The same intelligence theories indicate that common knowledge, job  specific experience, life experience, the ability of linguistic understanding and vocabulary (Gc  factor) increase with age; abilities which typically only take up a very small place in intelligence  tests – if they take up any place at all. Research indicates that many older people compensate  for their loss of cognitive abilities by choosing jobs or objectives or self-regulating strategies to  optimize the use of their existing knowledge and experience. In other words, adult development  may cause employees to pursue jobs/tasks, which attach importance to common knowledge  and job experience rather than cognitive abilities.  
• Reorganization. The theory is that the individual’s objectives of social interaction change with  age, i.e. a changed orientation in terms of time from ‘the time I have lived’ to ‘the time I have  left’. In early adulthood, people seek social interaction because of information value and the  potential positive consequences for their future career. For older people – those who focus on  ‘the time I have left’ – this motive is mitigated. In stead, they focus on more emotional support  and identity support. This shift often causes restructuring in the use of emotionally regulated  strategies (e.g. larger inclination to avoid conflicts, more frequent suppression of emotions etc.) 
• Readjustment. A number of behavior motives are readjusted with age. Thus, there seems to be  a shift in the significance of certain traits. Extrovert behavior, neurotic behavior or openness  to new experiences seem to be less prevailing with age. Thus, on average, older employees will  be less active, less nervous and anxious, less open to trying new ideas and less career-oriented.  Conversely, the average level of responsibility and companionableness increases. Another  readjustment is the tendency for the middle-age employee, in contrast to younger and older  employees, to react more positively to management strategies that emphasize cooperation  rather than competition.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
The figure shows that the biological development declines after the age of 40. There are then two  fundamental development trends for the psychological-spiritual development: 
• To follow the declining biological development 
• To follow a giving social phase or management phase.  
Lievegood explains that the work with the giving/rewarding management phase is initiated at the age  of 35 with a distinct shift to management tasks at the age of 49.  
Implications for management 
The above means that management practice which attempts to increase job effectiveness will succeed  or fail depending on the extent to which the job requires well-developed cognitive abilities. Jobs which  require good cognitive abilities will increasingly be perceived as difficult, the older the person is. The  older employee, who wants to maintain a high performance level in such a job, will probably try to  compensate by working more. This behavior or process may be supported emotionally but presumably  only in the short run and presumably only with the effect that the decline in performance does not occur  as quickly as in other instances. The increasing experience of ‘lacking abilities’ will in the longer run take  over and have bigger emotional effect through loss of self-efficacy and self-image.  
Conversely, employees in jobs that require knowledge and job and life experience will experience  increasing motivation as their abilities are increasingly significant to the work and thereby influence  their self-efficacy and self-image.  
Age-related motives and interest influence the perceived value of effort and performance. As age increases,  focus is increasingly put on identity and self-image, and the significance of the original motivational  factors (challenging objectives, bonus schemes etc.) changes in line with the employees’ changes needs.  
3.6 Pitfalls in focus on motivation 
A number of pitfalls are connected to focus on motivation and the theories comprising it: 
No motivational theory can stand alone 
We have presented a number of theories on factors which create motivated behavior. None of these  theories can be regarded as universal. On the contrary, put together, they provide a useful set of tools  consisting of perspectives, models and concrete advice. The individual theories have their own strengths  depending on the concrete motivational situation.

Organizational theory 
Motivational theories are complementary  
Focus on motivation 
The best way to secure high motivation is to view the motivational theories as complementary. Or  reversed: The theories are not mutually exclusive. They just have different approaches to the subject.  
Find the missing theory 
It is your task as manager to diagnose the concrete motivational situation in order to find out which  theory you may have overlooked.  
You must know – not think 
The biggest mistake you can make in the attempt to motivate your employees is to base your management  style and your standards on your own values and perceptions of motivation.  
Dialogue, dialogue and dialogue 
Motivated behavior is based on a complex set of internal and external factors, and the combination is  different from person to person and changes for each person over time. Ideally, your motivational task  should therefore be individualized. The qualification for choosing the right motivation strategy is open  and close dialogue with the concerned employees.

Organizational theory 
Focus on motivation 
All employees are complex human beings 
The final motivation for adults is the need to maintain and develop their ego perception and self-esteem.  We act in ways that correlate with the way in which we see ourselves; we avoid things which do not fit  into the way we see ourselves. We strive to feel good about ourselves, and we avoid situations which  make us feel bad about ourselves. Each employee is a complex human being, who may react in different  ways, and who constantly tries to shape situations to make them appear subjectively sensible.

Organizational theory 
Focus on adjustments to the external environment 
4 Focus on adjustments to the  external environment  
On the basis of previous chapters’ focus on ‘task performance and structure’ and ‘behavior and motivation’,  we will now explain the possibilities of combining these with the need for theories which open the  organization towards its surroundings. These combined theories with emphasis on adjustment to the  external environment represent the most recent organizational theories and are therefore very relevant to  the understanding of organizations today and in the future. Not least because the need for The Learning  Organization stands out clearly.  
Let us consider an example30 from the millennium change:  
On 15 March 2000, a smaller Danish company surprises by announcing that it has just been sold. At the  same time, the company takes the leadership position as the largest single business sale ever in Denmark.  Giga A/S has been sold to Intel for USD 1,250 billion. The principal shareholder NKT A/S and a number of  other shareholders, including Dansk Erhvervsinvestering, are encouraged by a successful ownership of an  IT company. Through various incentive programs, the purchase price also implies that the approximately  130 employees at Giga and the managing director, Finn Helmer, can share approximately DKK 1.7 billion.  
Eight years earlier, Giga was a company with six employees and great financial problems. However, the  scope of the problems was not clear until Finn Helmer reviewed the budgets and the cash position on  his first day at work on 1 February 1992. The cash budget looked fine and was in balance – at least on  paper. The budgets were based on a number of customers’ purchases, and Finn Helmer called the first  customer and in his own words used this introduction:  
“I can see that you need this amount of components, but I have not received your order yet. Could you  please forward it to me?” 
– after which the customer pointed out that they did not need to buy yet and therefore was not familiar  with the order. Then, Finn Helmer had to tell Giga’s chairman that the prospects of a profitable business in  the short term were poor. The state of affairs was that it was not possible to pay salaries the first months,  the company owed DKK 3 million, the loss for the next 12 months would be between approximately  DKK 3.5 and 4 million, and the sales would correspond with the size of the loss! The information to the  employees was the same, and they were also told not to expect a salary increase in the next two years  and to expect considerable overtime work. At the same time, all financial disposals exceeding DKK 100  had to be certified personally by Finn Helmer. In return, Finn Helmer promised his employees that they  would now work as a team, and that

Organizational theory “This will be fun!” 
Focus on adjustments to the external environment 
This example shows how complicated the connection between an organization and its surroundings  can be. It also shows the organizational possibilities of acknowledging and developing this connection.  
We apply organizational theories with an open perspective as a name for theories that emphasize the need  for a closer linkage between an organization and its surroundings characterized by mutual dependence.  In this connection, according to Scott31, an organization may be perceived as:  
A system of mutually dependent activities that chains together varying coalitions of participants.  The organization depends on its surrounding environment, which has a fundamental influence  on the organization. 
The open perspective has its starting point in systems theory and cybernetics, and perceives organizations  as complex, social systems, which are neither mechanic nor organic, but rather loose-coupled systems.  It is to be viewed in contrast to the tight coupling of the formal structure and motivational theories’  thoughts on flexible couplings within a relatively fixed structure. In loose-coupled organizations, the  individual organizational parts are able to act autonomously with adaptability in changing environments.

Organizational theory 
Focus on adjustments to the external environment 
When opening up to the external environment, the complexity in the connections between organization,  group and individual increases. The individual view is now expanded from the more obeying and  consensus-seeking group to a number of individuals with many interests. The individual has ambiguous  interests, which are difficult to predict. This creates a more complex image of the power in the organization  in which the individuals have greater opportunities for development within a common cultural framework.  
In this chapter, the most significant contributors will be reviewed with focus on motivation and adjustment  to the external environment: 
• Weick – Organizational model 
• March and Olsen – Organizational Learning 
• Argyris and Olsen – The Learning Organization 
• Schein, Martin and Albert & Whetten – Cultural theory 
In addition, the contribution from Lawrence, Lorsch and Galbraith concerning rational adjustment to  the external environment with the Contingency theory32 will be reviewed.  
4.1 Organizational model with loose couplings – K. Weick 
The main viewpoint in Weick’s organizational model is that the management should be aware that the  external environment is ambiguous and exists on the basis of the observer’s viewpoint. The individual  employee must be confident and reflect on his own behavior and actions. This awareness of creating  one’s own external environment is thereby more important than an attempt to understand and specify  an external environment which managers and employees would never fully understand anyway. In this  way, considerations about common sense become significant – more significant than what is true or false.  
In future organizations which are characterized by rapid technological development, it will be impossible  to fully understand and follow the technological development. Thus, the organization itself must design  its understanding of the world, and then shape and act accordingly.  
Weick has explained the necessity of loose couplings as one of the central characteristics of open  organizational forms. His viewpoint is that differentiated adjustment is required in relation to different  situations. This is the only way for the organization to survive and develop in a complex and contrasting  world.  
Weick therefore proposes a combination of: 
• A loose and independent organizational form which allows independent decisions and actions. • A dependency built into the organizational form as a coupling to the common whole.

Organizational theory 
Focus on adjustments to the external environment 
The concepts have the expedience that the organization attains interaction with its surroundings for  exchange of vital resources, and at the same time, the coupling creates an organizational identity by  separating the organization from its surroundings.  
Together with Orton, Weick has produced this interpretation of the concept of loose couplings:  
High degree of 
Elements with distinct  characteristics 
Elements without  distinct characteristics 
interaction between  elements 
Low degree of 
interaction between  elements  
Loose-coupled system Tight-coupled system Decoupled system Non-system 
Figure 4.1: Loose-coupled organizations 
This interpretation of loose-coupled systems presupposes a high degree of interaction between the  organizational units. The character of the systems gives each organizational unit the possibility of  preserving its distinctive character. These loose-coupled systems may take many different shapes, and  Orton and Weick33 themselves set out these seven forms of loose-coupled systems:  
• Between individuals 
• Between departments/groups 
• Between hierarchical levels 
• Between organization and external environment 
• Between activities 
• Between ideas 
• Between intentions and actions 
The list may be used to analyze and assess which type of loose couplings is crucial to the individual  organization, and should therefore not be tighter.
